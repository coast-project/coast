* Iterate from 0 to 255 instead from   0 to 255 since Apache 2.0.54 and 2.2.6 show   different behaviour:   2.0.54 does not resume the first and every modulo 256 sesssion,   2.2.6  does not resume the first session, but all following ones, which is correct   behaviour. ({ci_commit_link}43f0656a[43f0656a])

* removed dupliate declaration ({ci_commit_link}8b0eed92[8b0eed92])


* Call SetCount(0) on Mutex unlock and release countarray[fMutexId] slot. Don't remove countarray[fMutexId] slot on Mutex dtor since it is already done. Tread mutex count stored in countarrray as long ({ci_commit_link}9e3d4b2f[9e3d4b2f])

* bug fix removed obsolete fields ({ci_commit_link}70bc2ce6[70bc2ce6])


* added feature to internally retrying DB command if it fails  - specify SybDBTries > 1 to execute query more than once if it fails force closing connection if command execution failed  - it seemes that not closing the broken connection will leave us in a non recoverable state sometimes ({ci_commit_link}6a44a293[6a44a293])


* added method to GetStringFromRetcode  - useful when trying to lock down a problem error logging improved by printing textual retcode ({ci_commit_link}e7735d53[e7735d53])


* moved GetDestinationSlot from private to protected  - derived classes might wish to find out about their destination ({ci_commit_link}e3ce00e1[e3ce00e1])


* InterruptHandler passes its pid to the Server writing the PIDFile  - this is needed on Linux because thread/process handling is different than on Solaris ({ci_commit_link}836bb680[836bb680])


* added thread number parameter to DoAllocThread method ({ci_commit_link}87bd9071[87bd9071])

* gcc2.95 adaptions ({ci_commit_link}9b3cdc5b[9b3cdc5b])


* (Simple)?MutexEntry/RWLockEntry changed to LockUnlockEntry  - as it is now template based, the class name is the same for all types. RWLocks reading/writing flag has changed to a specific enumeration value which makes things clearer LockedValueIncrementDecrementEntry, former CountEntry, was added to Threads.h  - it increments a given value reference when entering and decrements the value when leaving Mutex constructor now throws an exception when fgpMutexIdMutex was not initialized yet ({ci_commit_link}3934380d[3934380d])


* new timings added ({ci_commit_link}b505caa9[b505caa9])

* changed to using SimpleMutex/Condition Start method now checks more than before  - counts the threads which could really be started against the PoolSize  - waits until all Threads have started before continuing  - sets Thread->SetRunningState(eWorking) to have another way to synchronize their start, ignored by thread if not checked for Update also counts the Threads which terminated already  - this is needed in Start, not to wait on started Threads forever ({ci_commit_link}1cca4401[1cca4401])


* sending SIGTERM to interrupt handler in dtor to forca its shutdown  - otherwise it would block in the sigwait() call ({ci_commit_link}8197a7c0[8197a7c0])

* make StreserThread's THRID() adjusted by an eventually passed in OFFSET=nn argument available   in environment. ("IdAndCurrentOffset")   This can be useful when userid's used in stress-tests are derived from the running thread's id   but must be adjusted for some reasons by an OFFSET. ({ci_commit_link}022d99fe[022d99fe])


* added Trace ({ci_commit_link}56d0d7dc[56d0d7dc])

* extended/corrected CheckPath to return if path given is a symbolic link  - in case a path is a link pointing to either a directory or file, the st_mode member could not be used anymore to find this out when using only lstat  -> now a call to both lstat and stat will be done to be more specific and correct again ({ci_commit_link}9b09b20a[9b09b20a])


* added system trace switch ({ci_commit_link}9cc73014[9cc73014])

* allocation/use of mutexcountarray optimized ({ci_commit_link}a8e0fec8[a8e0fec8])


* adjusted tests to to moved DoubleToString conversion method ({ci_commit_link}02e0cd50[02e0cd50])


* added DoubleToString conversion method as static class member int and double to string conversion can be selected from either using iostram based conversion (which potentially creates locks) or snprintf based conversion  - set compiler flag IOSTREAM_NUM_CONVERSION if you want to use iostream based conversion, otherwise snprintf conversion will be used ({ci_commit_link}f25ccc64[f25ccc64])


* changed to using DoubleToString conversion of String ({ci_commit_link}11086ea9[11086ea9])


* re-moved DoubleToString conversion method to String double and long conversions will be delegated to String ({ci_commit_link}467dbfe7[467dbfe7])

* Allow buffered loggin Added Testcases ({ci_commit_link}793a0728[793a0728])


* added class instance variables which   don't have to be extracted from the config   every LogAll() call ({ci_commit_link}1f30a815[1f30a815])


* Speed refactoring, use class instance vars ({ci_commit_link}3a59f4df[3a59f4df])


* This file is identical with version 1.41   Versions 1.42 until 1.43 are kept to make them   still available ({ci_commit_link}64cf3546[64cf3546])


* This version is equal to version 1.79 Versions 1.80 until 1.81 not deleted to make them still available ({ci_commit_link}e248006c[e248006c])

* added Terminate call in destructor to cleanup ({ci_commit_link}0dd76f8d[0dd76f8d])


* old session was not unlocked in InitSession() when fUnlockSession was false (default)  - this lead to mutex destruction errors because the mutex was still in use when deleting such sessions ({ci_commit_link}774243fd[774243fd])

* added error message when pool was still in use ({ci_commit_link}258d330b[258d330b])


* added lock when ServerThread gets shutdown  - unfortunately there is no way yet to be sure that the PrepareShutdown exited before DoTerminatedRunMethodHook gets called  -> this could lead to undefined behavior ({ci_commit_link}44e8496d[44e8496d])


* corrected returned error code ({ci_commit_link}0208d8d0[0208d8d0])


* adjusted time measurement test ({ci_commit_link}73d9baa3[73d9baa3])

* corrected cleanup of thread resources added additional mutex macro param ({ci_commit_link}1af4e450[1af4e450])


* added additional macro parameter for mutex operations to get out return code  - this return code can be useful in determining the real problem ({ci_commit_link}f83fdd23[f83fdd23])


* adjusted appending of syserr-message ({ci_commit_link}78994d46[78994d46])


* added trace switches ({ci_commit_link}a5845c51[a5845c51])


* testcases extended to prove the functionality of AliasInstaller ({ci_commit_link}9d7c8464[9d7c8464])


* added more checks for alias installer specifications  - an empty alias name lead to coredumps when shutting down  - specific messages get printed when a misconfiguration gets detected ({ci_commit_link}9811624b[9811624b])


* adjusted copying defaults ({ci_commit_link}0c8618aa[0c8618aa])


* corrected range processing when negative tokens were specified ({ci_commit_link}8d996838[8d996838])


* added testcase to prove working of StringTokenizeRenderer when a negative range was specified like /RenderTokens "-4--1" ({ci_commit_link}22904927[22904927])


* definition of limit values only needed on linux for gcc < 4 ({ci_commit_link}cdacf8a5[cdacf8a5])


* fixed typo ({ci_commit_link}9bcf7ee9[9bcf7ee9])


* adjusted tests which use MemTracker specific knowledge  - some of them work only if TRACE_STORAGE is set to a certain level ({ci_commit_link}80822032[80822032])


* MemTracker will only get created when TRACE_STORAGE >= 1 ({ci_commit_link}1fec8c54[1fec8c54])


* hardened test condition ({ci_commit_link}a72a80c2[a72a80c2])


* added some results ({ci_commit_link}e5a16b61[e5a16b61])


* adjusted test due to variable name changes added two tests to show behavior of ExcessMemory allocation and splitting larger blocks ({ci_commit_link}13a28ec6[13a28ec6])


* adjusted tests which use MemTracker specific knowledge  - some of them work only if TRACE_STORAGE is set to a certain level ({ci_commit_link}b48e79bb[b48e79bb])


* re-enabled tests of excess tracker depending on the TRACE_STORAGE level ({ci_commit_link}a8c1a0d7[a8c1a0d7])


* adjusted description of bucket sizes parameter hopefully for the last time  - I changed the comment to mention the usable size of specific buckets which is 8192bytes when NumOfPoolBucketSizes is set to 10  -> now the usable size on linux and solaris is the same, unfortunately the MemoryHeader::AlignedSize() differed so that some tests did fail on some platforms ({ci_commit_link}d6bddc0b[d6bddc0b])


* added more test results ({ci_commit_link}35b8b914[35b8b914])


* adjusted description of bucket sizes parameter hopefully for the last time  - I changed the comment to mention the usable size of specific buckets which is 8192bytes when NumOfPoolBucketSizes is set to 10  -> now the usable size on linux and solaris is the same, unfortunately the MemoryHeader::AlignedSize() differed so that some tests did fail on some platforms splitting a larger bucket into smaller ones when requesting more buckets in a fully used pool will not work nicely anymore because the next larger bucket is double in payload size but this will not allow two smaller buckets (payload+MemoryHeaderSize) to fit  - as this can be avoided by specifying enough poolmemory, I see no problem in having changed this behavior tracking statistics can be enabled by setting TRACE_STORAGE appropriately -> see Storage::fglStatisticLevel  - the only performance drawback when disabled is comparing a pointer value optimized calling locations of TrackAlloc/TrackFree ({ci_commit_link}08038b7c[08038b7c])


* used bucket tracking now only works for pooled buckets  - this reduces overhead for GlobalAllocator which does not use bucket counting removed unused MemTracker::Init() method ({ci_commit_link}7aa130fe[7aa130fe])


* renamed usable size variable to clarify when using it ({ci_commit_link}dd8fbf53[dd8fbf53])


* tracing of used blocks can now be enabled by setting TRACE_STORAGE=3 renamed of MemoryHeader variable improved used block dump output format ({ci_commit_link}47a29aa9[47a29aa9])


* extended TRACE_STORAGE levels to 3  - 3: trace memory blocks which were still in use when freeing Allocator ({ci_commit_link}772a8b57[772a8b57])


* MemChecker will only print out when memory was consumed and not freed MemTracker will only get created when TRACE_STORAGE >=1 added Storage::Initialize() before creating GlobalAllocator to have a correct value in GetStatisticLevel() ({ci_commit_link}b8f41726[b8f41726])


* adde method to get statistic level which gets initialized by the value of TRACE_STORAGE environment variable  - see also documentation of fglStatisticLevel ({ci_commit_link}41b5e374[41b5e374])


* adjusted block size comment for NumOfPoolBuckets ({ci_commit_link}c94105bc[c94105bc])


* changed ServerName string to be on Global storage ({ci_commit_link}2057f809[2057f809])


* added some MT_Storage switches ({ci_commit_link}670d95ec[670d95ec])


* added new state transition state eStartInProgress which is not activated currently  - prepared variable to store arguments passed in Start() for later call to DoStartedHook() ({ci_commit_link}7e515bf7[7e515bf7])


* changed default of fRefreshAllocator to false ({ci_commit_link}0d4ad20c[0d4ad20c])

* added MemTrackerTest ({ci_commit_link}2b809401[2b809401])


* added test to see if memory blocks in use get dumped to stderr (optical test...) ({ci_commit_link}abfb7389[abfb7389])


* added Allocator parameter to constructors and static methods  - allows allocation of the internally used string buffer in the correct memory location changed two of the constructors to explicit, eg. you need to specify the correct type when wanting to use it ({ci_commit_link}343e13c0[343e13c0])


* added getters for internal values modified the TrackAlloc/TrackFree interface to take a MemoryHeader* instead of just the memory size used  - allows tracking of used blocks which then can be used to dump the still allocated blocks of memory ({ci_commit_link}b5666137[b5666137])


* changed the minimal allocation block size to 32 as if we allocate a 16byte block of memory, all the space would get used by the MemoryHeader  - if 32 is the smallest size, we would get 16bytes of MemoryHeader and 16bytes to use for the caller changed direct member access to using getters added methods to DumpStillAllocated memory blocks ({ci_commit_link}7fc2c158[7fc2c158])

* changed CacheHandlerMutexAllocator priority removed termination message ({ci_commit_link}9515f0c3[9515f0c3])


* calling MT_Storage::UnregisterThread() in CleanupThread  - more safety concerning thread cleanup and destruction using ThreadId instead of thread-address as PoolAllocator id now, easier to match ({ci_commit_link}5f82d316[5f82d316])


* added some traces tracing pool bucket in case it was not freed when terminating ({ci_commit_link}a050eff1[a050eff1])

* GetSemaCount test enabled for all platforms ({ci_commit_link}b4bae3ce[b4bae3ce])


* changed threading on Solaris to pthreads releasing thread resources in Exit() method  -> will not increase thread resource count in top anymore (solaris) ({ci_commit_link}8a2bba23[8a2bba23])


* changed threading on Solaris to pthreads added macros for defining GETSEMACOUNT, THRSIGSETMASK ({ci_commit_link}cbe13abc[cbe13abc])


* when 'delete other configs' was specified, initial switching of prjconfig.sh should not remove other configs yet  - otherwise, alias rules might lead to nonsense ({ci_commit_link}58c06658[58c06658])

* added default flag entries for MMAP stream control and Storage tracing ({ci_commit_link}5fa1a103[5fa1a103])


* performance fix for PoolAllocators MemTrackers  - as PoolAllocators should only be used by one thread at a time, we should not create a MT_MemTracker but use a MemTracker instead ({ci_commit_link}45b05f1f[45b05f1f])


* added shell function to get out the value of an environment variable being set from within a script file ({ci_commit_link}00546c51[00546c51])

* added tests for assertCompare ({ci_commit_link}ae567e74[ae567e74])


* added new assert Macro assertCompare[m] which prints values in case of non-success  - allows comparison of values with either one of [equal_to|not_equal_to|less|less_equal|greater|greater_equal] specifiers  - instead of t_assert(x<y), use assertCompare(x, less, y) ({ci_commit_link}632ef903[632ef903])


* added TString::Append methods for different long-types  - changed sprintf to snprintf ({ci_commit_link}236646fb[236646fb])


* changed warning that file cannot be loaded into info ({ci_commit_link}d434855b[d434855b])


* persisting test results ({ci_commit_link}c2418548[c2418548])

* adjusted some trace switches ({ci_commit_link}18bde762[18bde762])


* improved handling of return codes  - added StatusCode enumerator which carries more information than just a bool  -> in case a Put/Get call was successful, Queue::eSuccess will be returned, other codes otherwise Both sides of the queue can be un-/blocked individually  - this allows blocking the Put side for example, while still emptying the queue using Get calls  -> allows easier implementations of termination sequences ({ci_commit_link}ff77f8f0[ff77f8f0])


* Beautyfied code. ({ci_commit_link}fa33de99[fa33de99])


* Generate a unique id. Added testcases ({ci_commit_link}982de3b6[982de3b6])

* added rotator-termination timeout not to wait on termination infinitely ({ci_commit_link}3880f00c[3880f00c])


* correction of signal handling  - when starting a multithreaded application, signal handling must be blocked for all threads, except the one to handle signals, because the signal mask will be inherited the signal handler must be the sole instance allowing to handle all needed signals ({ci_commit_link}e7f158e4[e7f158e4])


* added timings ({ci_commit_link}73e88f8b[73e88f8b])

* if source/dest did overlap in memcopy,   the resulting string was corrupted. Added tests ({ci_commit_link}4a7a5423[4a7a5423])


* removed setting of LD_RUN_PATH to reduce 'hardcoded' references to directories ({ci_commit_link}73d22185[73d22185])


* fixed subtle bug when string's length   is 0, then not only the memory for   the chars to fill has to be reserved...   After memcpying the fill chars to their destination   the Strings length has to be incremented up to the number   of filled in chars. ({ci_commit_link}c275a6b4[c275a6b4])


* adjusted old config_ files to new init/finis methods ({ci_commit_link}d66e015a[d66e015a])

* refactored and simplyfied code, it did not   like my own writing... ({ci_commit_link}2fe06a56[2fe06a56])


* removed LD_ASSUME_KERNEL because it does not solve the GLIBC problem on all Linux systems  - instead, you need a set of 'old' glibc libraries to use for starting these non-conforming applications  -> see sniff_wrapper script to see how it is done ({ci_commit_link}13ef0f3d[13ef0f3d])


* added some statistics of cons ({ci_commit_link}72fc90ac[72fc90ac])


* added more test results ({ci_commit_link}83eb85f5[83eb85f5])

* added PrependWith method.   Prepends the String with given char until it has reached newLen.   If passed in (desired) newLen is smaller than the Strings length   the method is a no-op. added Testcase ({ci_commit_link}74ee57ff[74ee57ff])


* Corrected background of MultiFunctionListBoxRenderer ({ci_commit_link}dc66718c[dc66718c])


* handle multiple COOKIE: lines correctly   see RFC2965, RFC2616 added tests ({ci_commit_link}9f6fc07e[9f6fc07e])


* Although inccorrect according to   "Errata to RFC 2965, HTTP State Management"   COOKIE: headers like this are created by FireFox & IE   COOKIE: mycookie1=value1; mycookie2=sessionid=4,lang=de,color=blue; ....   MIMEHeader first split the string by , which is correct according to   RFC2965. For cookies, the separator is ; and the procedure has to be   the following:   Split cookie string by ;   Normalize the string (remove leading/trailing blanks etc)   Split the string by key/values   Assign the result to fHeader["COOKIE"] ({ci_commit_link}ea2295b5[ea2295b5])

* removed II-hour option  - is now the same as HH specifier ({ci_commit_link}c137d92d[c137d92d])


* refactoring and bugfixing  - numbers like month or day had always to be two digits long, which was in fact a bit stupid, because the first of the month is just one digit  - parsing of input string is more flexible now ({ci_commit_link}aa2858a1[aa2858a1])


* added ComputeDateRenderer trace entries ({ci_commit_link}40e8a5fc[40e8a5fc])


* GetElement takes additional bTryLock parameter   This allows callers who don't want to block on a empty queue   to use the  "TryLock" (sort of peeking) feature already implemented   in the underlying Queue abstraction. The default is set to false, thus not disturbing existing code   Added testcase ({ci_commit_link}d6dd4dd1[d6dd4dd1])


* renamed Work() method to Enter() which is the method used in PoolManagers   to dispatch the workload. (Made naming more consistent) ({ci_commit_link}f6ce1a54[f6ce1a54])

* corrected trace name ({ci_commit_link}93d67701[93d67701])


* changed build platforms to opt-wddbg instead of dbg  - first of all, on ftan, dbg-compilation leads to undeterministic behavior of library loading??  - as we use opt-wddbg most of the development time, I think it makes sense to have this setting tested in favour of the seldomly used dbg setting ({ci_commit_link}68db2191[68db2191])


* fixed tracing ({ci_commit_link}1f1b0fc1[1f1b0fc1])

* changed header ({ci_commit_link}38bd8e84[38bd8e84])


* needed to add ServersModule to initialize Application-objects config adjusted tests due to ConfNamedObject/WDModule/Registry changes  - added <object>->Initialize(category) where needed  - changed tests to configured tests with dll and module loading to initialize all registered objects needed for tests ({ci_commit_link}19c8cec4[19c8cec4])


* needed to add ServersModule to initialize Application-objects config ({ci_commit_link}a1b267cf[a1b267cf])


* adjusted tests due to ConfNamedObject/WDModule/Registry changes  - added <object>->Initialize(category) where needed  - changed tests to configured tests with dll and module loading to initialize all registered objects needed for tests ({ci_commit_link}1f9a4e4e[1f9a4e4e])


* adjusted some traces ({ci_commit_link}33726244[33726244])

* removed implicit checkconfig calls ({ci_commit_link}7bf5b95d[7bf5b95d])


* loading of object config gets postponed now until a corresponding WDModule initializes the registered objects  - this was needed because the static object initialization sequence and thus the use of the underlying CacheHandler::Get method was not controllable -> as side effect, it might be needed to add modules to the /Modules section of the application or tests configuration! ({ci_commit_link}fe8c4bea[fe8c4bea])


* removed unused old cleaner code added some traces which is safe now ({ci_commit_link}544d1287[544d1287])

* removed termination of SysLog  - this is now done in the correct place ({ci_commit_link}dfb133bf[dfb133bf])

* adjusted thread names ({ci_commit_link}11c3a63e[11c3a63e])


* simplified Thread-id handling by using SimpleMutex implemented initialization using InitFinisManager corrected re-use implementation of thread  - this was not safe before because setting the thread to terminated could occur after the thread was re-aquired to use again ({ci_commit_link}1ca276ee[1ca276ee])


* modified memtracker/allocator to have a unique id for tracing adjusted StorageHooks related things ({ci_commit_link}b76a8c84[b76a8c84])

* corrected gcc2.95.x build failure  - friend declaration must occur after inner class declaration ({ci_commit_link}d51f54b3[d51f54b3])


* error correction in RotateTime calculation  - due to a mix-up of hour and minute, the rotation second was not initialized correctly  -> this lead to never-rotated logfiles again... added testcases to explicitly check for RotateTime settings now ({ci_commit_link}54fca5c2[54fca5c2])


* added more tests to prove behavior ({ci_commit_link}644fd5e0[644fd5e0])


* corrected error when list to process was empty  - due to added start/end feature, the case when start=0 and listsize=0 lead to a false exit because start should not be greater than listsize  -> corrected this error and added shortcut exit in case the list is empty ({ci_commit_link}8949daa9[8949daa9])


* changed direct TmpStore accesses to context.Lookup ({ci_commit_link}70f0cf0d[70f0cf0d])


* If no /Header format is given, don't write (blank) header line. If SuppressEmptyLines is set and an empty file is logged, Log() should   return true, not false. (And this it does by now). Added the missing tests for the /SupressEmptyLines behaviour and added test for   Header line format spec not given. ({ci_commit_link}28dd9be8[28dd9be8])


* added useful trace ({ci_commit_link}5fde936a[5fde936a])


* removed RunOnly tests ({ci_commit_link}3f5caa3b[3f5caa3b])

* cosmetic updates ({ci_commit_link}375104a7[375104a7])

* logfiles will be rotated again  - due to a wrong CheckState param, the logrotator got blocked until program restart new option RotateSecond  - instead of specifying hh:mm[:ss], the second in the day can be given new Channel-Option DoNotRotate  - if set to 1, the channel will not rotate its logfile ({ci_commit_link}f7e5f253[f7e5f253])


* error correction for stores/slots not in same allocator  - slots were not removed when the caller got called from a different allocator-storage    this is due to the fact that an Anything copies itself when it detects the assignee to have a different allocator  -> this can be solved using a reference to the store, but care must be taken not to change the entry-reference to point to somewhere else ({ci_commit_link}bbdd1b82[bbdd1b82])

({ci_commit_link}2cd226d1[2cd226d1])


* added non-virtual-interface for ConfiguredClone  - virtual method is DoConfiguredClone  -> this allows derived classes to create configured object hierarchies before CheckConfig gets called  --> this is important for HierarchConfNamed objects where base class DoLookup will be called when no object specific config is found ({ci_commit_link}ac95b0c7[ac95b0c7])

* removed SetupCase because it is not needed here ({ci_commit_link}efa78fb4[efa78fb4])


* changed from Anything& to ROAnything interface ({ci_commit_link}cfe7b5ff[cfe7b5ff])


* adjusted tests to new template based TestCase interface  - TestCase also moved to namespace TestFramework ({ci_commit_link}f811c944[f811c944])


* removed unused stuff will be eliminated in future when dll/module loading policies are established ({ci_commit_link}f2b667d3[f2b667d3])


* rendered obsolete through special config loading policy -> see AnythingConfigTestPolicy.h ({ci_commit_link}841c8fd6[841c8fd6])


* removed file ({ci_commit_link}e3fce1e2[e3fce1e2])


* deleted file ({ci_commit_link}8e385b41[8e385b41])


* adjusted tests to new template based TestCase interface  - TestCase also moved to namespace TestFramework ({ci_commit_link}68ecb5ce[68ecb5ce])


* files obsoleted ({ci_commit_link}d300eba6[d300eba6])


* renamed XML etst file added TimeStamp statistic file ({ci_commit_link}c3c40802[c3c40802])


* changed names of statistic files ({ci_commit_link}98190b1b[98190b1b])


* include file cleanup ({ci_commit_link}24d1ef6a[24d1ef6a])

* small changes ({ci_commit_link}67ddffd7[67ddffd7])


* Initial step of TestCase refactoring  - added policy to control config loading  - added policy to control statistic catching  -> anything based implementations can be found in project testfwFoundation which will be added in the next commits  -> see FoundationTestTypes.h for preconfigured types of available tests so far expect additional policies to come for:  - dll-loading  - module-loading and initialization ({ci_commit_link}28e48cd0[28e48cd0])


* changed trace settings ({ci_commit_link}5ad60436[5ad60436])


* corrected Role level check ({ci_commit_link}b9dd0bc5[b9dd0bc5])


* adjusted code due to move of IsCertCheckPassed()   method from SSLConnector to SSLSocket ({ci_commit_link}11331779[11331779])


* adjusted testcases due to move of IsCertCheckPassed()   method from SSLConnector to SSLSocket ({ci_commit_link}8650ff30[8650ff30])


* Moved IsCertCheckPassed method from SSLConnector to SSLSocket. The framework's ssl implementation   provides support for server and client sockets. (All needed data to perform the checks done by   IsCertCheckPassed() is prepared and placed in the Ctx and sockets's ClientInfo and SSLParameters   object).   Because cert checking can be done on *server* and client sockets, the IsCertCheckPassed method must   be moved to the Sockets interface. So far the method was only available from a SSLConnector object and   therefore restricted to client sockets. ({ci_commit_link}5d505336[5d505336])


* implemented Role into Params of Url to change role by server change ({ci_commit_link}77c88cb3[77c88cb3])

* new Mapper to allow dynamic change of Put-Key according to Rendererspec ({ci_commit_link}3aaf1ee3[3aaf1ee3])


* added config params Delim and IndexDelim for cases where default behavior is not wanted adjusted doxygen comments changed all Get/Put methods to be non-virtual  - only DoXXX methods need to be virtual moved all DoXXX methods to protected section  - implication was that I needed to add a bunch of friends  -> friends must be eliminated in future! ({ci_commit_link}8c50a7c4[8c50a7c4])


* added config params Delim and IndexDelim for cases where default behavior is not wanted optimized SlotFinder::Operate to use non-Anything param variant ({ci_commit_link}191d8806[191d8806])


* optimized month lookup factored out convert method and made it static  - should be a method of System::DateTime or equivalent in future ({ci_commit_link}95a3a7a2[95a3a7a2])


* added option to supply a UnixTime instead of current time ({ci_commit_link}d271eab7[d271eab7])


* making use of simpler Operate method ({ci_commit_link}98281868[98281868])


* added more traces ({ci_commit_link}327556f2[327556f2])


* changed Input parameter 'RenderToken' to Renderspec ({ci_commit_link}a9dd2837[a9dd2837])

* added documentation niceified code ({ci_commit_link}6d4d72b7[6d4d72b7])


* upgraded file to doxygen 1.4.6  - enabled some options for improved output ({ci_commit_link}3a5140d1[3a5140d1])


* - unnessecary Trace removed ({ci_commit_link}e2951f21[e2951f21])


* replaced AppendAnyAlways with appropriate PutPolicy ({ci_commit_link}b89187b9[b89187b9])


* replaced AppendAnyAlways with PutPolicy  - policy values are Put and Append, the default behavior still remains the same  - Put mode does always replace an existing value  - Append always puts values into an array ({ci_commit_link}746b89ca[746b89ca])


* corrected file rotating when terminating AppLog  - files were accidentally rotated during module termination ({ci_commit_link}0e362b5d[0e362b5d])


* merged in changes between cvs_head repository ({ci_commit_link}fd062b8c[fd062b8c])


* adjusted IP-Address ({ci_commit_link}3d594b2f[3d594b2f])


* FileLoadRenderer renders error message like "file not found" directly   to the stream which for most usages is what we want becaus that way   it becomes obious that something is misconfigured.   However sometimes we don't want an error message rendered. The new switch   /Quiet "yes" (default is "no") just allows this. Added test cases ({ci_commit_link}857a97dd[857a97dd])


* - added Result trace, result is better to read while testing ({ci_commit_link}d2d9f777[d2d9f777])

* corrected HTML generation in HTMLDebug mode ({ci_commit_link}32f61be6[32f61be6])


* scripts of navigation buttons should be inserted at correct location now  - depending on button rendering, the scripts should be rendered either inside a <td> tag or standalone removed HidePrintButton  - use /PrintButton * to achieve tha same ({ci_commit_link}38494684[38494684])

* adjusted output style of testdata ({ci_commit_link}fa3a93c7[fa3a93c7])


* changed processing of input stream  - the first part is to read the whole stream into a string buffer  - after the buffer was successfully read, anything conversion gets done  -> this could slow down the conversion process but offers better status and trace handling ({ci_commit_link}b6e03457[b6e03457])


* removing directories generated for test ({ci_commit_link}aa55d22c[aa55d22c])


* changed structure of output ({ci_commit_link}7005bd4a[7005bd4a])

* added cleanup of generated files ({ci_commit_link}24f46182[24f46182])


* adjusted test output due to new PlainBinaryValues setting ({ci_commit_link}89ee433a[89ee433a])


* changed tests due to interface changes of ErrorHandler ({ci_commit_link}818cfa99[818cfa99])


* changed interface of TransformResult removed fMAPUTF8 member and changed to looking it up ({ci_commit_link}799bbc70[799bbc70])


* added PlainBinaryValues parameter postfix to prefix increment optimization ({ci_commit_link}d089b28e[d089b28e])


* interface of GetQuery and GetParams changed changed to new AnyImpl type postfix to prefix increment optimization ({ci_commit_link}1bc44f7b[1bc44f7b])

* added cleanup of generated files ({ci_commit_link}ec8d83a5[ec8d83a5])


* splitted contents of Anything.h|cpp into corresponding parts  - easier to change impls without forcing full recompilation because of Anything dependencies  - added separate type to distinguish Impls postfix to prefix increment optimization ({ci_commit_link}12045049[12045049])


* prepared for extensible comparers ({ci_commit_link}d4a78843[d4a78843])


* postfix to prefix increment optimization ({ci_commit_link}d4ad3d0d[d4ad3d0d])


* removed duplicated Scrambler entry ({ci_commit_link}b37a68d7[b37a68d7])


* GetASessionsInfo pushes the session for which the session info is retrieved on the context.   Side effect: The old session (the session the actual request is made) is dereferenced, which   makes the session vulnerable to a deletion by the session cleaner.   In practice this does not happen because:   - Internal pages are rendered locked, thus the session is "busy" and will not be removed   - The customer timeout is longer then it takes to fulfill the session info query Nevertheless, the behaviour is flawed and has been fixed:   - Increment RefCount of session stored in ctx when session stored in ctx is unequal the one GetASessionsInfo queries   - Decrement RefCount of session stored in ctx when done Added testcase Added debug info ({ci_commit_link}c0b4e57c[c0b4e57c])

* adjusted param LDAPTimeout to LDAPTimeLimit ({ci_commit_link}85f27703[85f27703])


* corrected "one" to "base"  - onelevel or base is correct but in this context we need base ({ci_commit_link}87a90fc7[87a90fc7])


* added file to reduce warning messages ({ci_commit_link}8f7f4b7d[8f7f4b7d])


* added empty throw() to new operator  - eliminates appropriate compiler warning ({ci_commit_link}c1f52ed9[c1f52ed9])

* added include for memeset ({ci_commit_link}bc5995d2[bc5995d2])


* forgot to check in header file ({ci_commit_link}466ada87[466ada87])


* Following the guidelines in   http://www.mozilla.org/directory/csdk-docs/threaded.htm#set_thread_structure   the access to the errno variable has to be made thread safe.   if compiled with the threads option errno is a macro using thread specific memory   and making sure that every thread has it's own instance off errno.   Since we cannot konw how "our" libldap was compiled, the ldap sdk offers some   hook methods to wrap the call to errno. Because errno is called within a callback   which *we* compile, the right thread safe errno macro will be expanded and compiled. Fixed testcases ({ci_commit_link}dc9c40cb[dc9c40cb])


* removed using directive because of problems with older compilers ({ci_commit_link}97eb5362[97eb5362])

* added more tests to show LookupStores behavior ({ci_commit_link}e7f93dea[e7f93dea])


* changed semantics of LookupStores  - it acts similar to LookupObjects now where the whole stack will be searched    in case a slot could not be found in the top pushed element ({ci_commit_link}7b296e46[7b296e46])


* added using directive to avoid DoTest shadowing ({ci_commit_link}d7f86ff5[d7f86ff5])


* improved logging in case a slotname can not be found as renderer ({ci_commit_link}9b835836[9b835836])


* simplified some methods  - eliminated duplicate Lookup in case of tracing ({ci_commit_link}af5fb742[af5fb742])

* removed Trace in dtor of CleanupInitializer setting allocator Id to ThreadId in case the allocator has Id==0  - should simplify identification of PoolStorage ({ci_commit_link}2f85b527[2f85b527])


* made dtor of CleanupHandler virtual ({ci_commit_link}d72d85e4[d72d85e4])


* modified MT_Storage and MTStorageHooks  - using FinalCleaner class for clean shutdown corrected cleanup error where also the GlobalStorage was deleted ({ci_commit_link}7f8607a6[7f8607a6])

* removed obsolete Storage::SetHooks(0) ({ci_commit_link}aa2c2558[aa2c2558])


* enhanced SlotPutter and SlotCleaner with simple parameter interface added EnsureArrayImpl static method in Anything ({ci_commit_link}e58ebfb1[e58ebfb1])

* Foo complaint (:-   Fixed testcase ({ci_commit_link}8d3508df[8d3508df])


* fixed typo ({ci_commit_link}b06cbb31[b06cbb31])


* Changed behaviour of HttpFlowController when cookies wit no domain are preset in the   incoming request. In this case the best thing that can be done is to assign all these   cookies to the same domain. (Code already contained a statement doing this for ports   80/443, but it should be done for all ports. Removed dead wood HttpFlowController handles redirects based upon:   meta tag "refresh"   and new   location: headerfield ({ci_commit_link}08f6ed49[08f6ed49])

* streamlined traces ({ci_commit_link}8b3812d8[8b3812d8])


* code correction  - already existing Null-Any lead to resulting any in no-mans-land ({ci_commit_link}c08728af[c08728af])


* completely refactored persistent ldap connections. the maximum number of connections per connection pool may be specified on the fly retry option if ldap connection becomes bad problem of running out of filehandles seems to be solved added lots of new testcases For functionality and design principles seee header files in changed source files. ({ci_commit_link}db1f0edc[db1f0edc])

* adjusted documentation ({ci_commit_link}871ab6f7[871ab6f7])


* added more tests to ensure header field access ({ci_commit_link}773a2659[773a2659])

* fixed trace ({ci_commit_link}6ce085e9[6ce085e9])


* use Mutex instead of RWLock because lookups (so far protected with read-RWLocks)   into the global Anythings used to store SSLCtx and SSLSessions   change the Anything when a slot is not present.   The assumption that the Anything itself is a immutable object would hold true   only if all required slots would be initialised at module bootup, which is not   possible because we don't know the thread id's then. Fixed code where an object exposed to multithreaded accesses was not locked. ({ci_commit_link}ac3cdfb1[ac3cdfb1])

* further 'cleanup' of Mappers  - the DestinationSlot entry will be entered into TmpStore after the last Put call  - this allows subsequent mappers to override the slot with other content but letting the first name remain in context after call added temporary overriding api for some special mappers ({ci_commit_link}afaa94cc[afaa94cc])


* force the stream to be flushed by using separate scope ({ci_commit_link}14e80f6e[14e80f6e])


* using PushPopEntry instead of PushStore and PopStore ({ci_commit_link}9c9ec279[9c9ec279])

* adjusted some switches ({ci_commit_link}fbc43e07[fbc43e07])


* adjusted StatTrace params, converted some to StartTrace ({ci_commit_link}5b7553cd[5b7553cd])


* added bracket in trace ({ci_commit_link}8239e296[8239e296])


* fixed path to hashed certs dir ({ci_commit_link}c1aed228[c1aed228])


* WorkerThread:  - removed DoReadyHook method which was used to notify the PoolManager and to refresh Allocator  -- the pointer to WorkerPoolManager was removed entirely because it was bad practice  -- refreshing allocator moved to Run method because doing it in DoReadyHook could fill pool memory again with traces...  - Init method equal to Thread Init WorkerPoolManager  - deriving from Observer to receive Threads notifications  -- this is used to track WorkerThread transitions from Ready<->Working ({ci_commit_link}99501ca1[99501ca1])


* eliminated symbolik link, because ln behaves   differently on Solaris and Linux ({ci_commit_link}d03d5c6f[d03d5c6f])


* adjusted comment ({ci_commit_link}559bde26[559bde26])


* removed obsolete FIXME comment ({ci_commit_link}9991cf3c[9991cf3c])


* removed unused ifdef ({ci_commit_link}bbbc3c38[bbbc3c38])


* added allocator parameter for StatTrace macros  - this is needed because the underlying debugging interface requires this    this behavior is needed because we mainly use Storage::Current() but for static tracing we could use Storage::Global() not to influence Allocator statistics ({ci_commit_link}262574aa[262574aa])


* using new MemTrack macros for printing statistics ({ci_commit_link}2d330d3b[2d330d3b])


* added macro definitions for printing out tracker statistics  - conditional macro added to print only when something was allocated using the Allocator ({ci_commit_link}1f9cb130[1f9cb130])


* fixed path to hashed certs dir ({ci_commit_link}206e8a0f[206e8a0f])


* Trace changes:  - changed everything from 'locking' Storage::Global() to Storage::Current()  -> this had some consequences in Threading but these locations are fixed now  -> also notice the new Allocator* param in static trace macros  - did some optimization in storing char* values where possible ({ci_commit_link}fdeb322f[fdeb322f])


* adjusted some traces ({ci_commit_link}f3c654b9[f3c654b9])


* WIN32 specific adjustment of new ThreadState ({ci_commit_link}efe458db[efe458db])


* format of Thread::BroadcastEvt changed  - instead of a single unidentifieable value I added following structure:    /RunningState { /Old ? /New ? }    /ThreadState { /Old ? /New ? } ({ci_commit_link}6e3468e7[6e3468e7])


* changed termination state handling  - Thread::eTerminated will now be set when IntRun() method returns, it was right after Run() returned before  - to be notified of a finished Run() method call I added Thread::eTerminatedRunMethod which is semantically identical to Thread::eTerminated before  -> the old behavior was especially bad when a thread was used with PoolAllocators and tracing enabled. This resulted in situations where IntRun() still had some trace memory allocated     but the corresponding PoolAllocator already scheduled for deletion! This was the evil time of core dumps...  - to be really sure that traces do not occupy memory anymore I also added a wait loop in ~AllocUnref to come around the problem of potential allocated trace memory in (Simple)Mutex traces CleanupThreadStorage also moved out to THREADWRAPPERFUNC ({ci_commit_link}abdcfedd[abdcfedd])


* removed som old stuff ({ci_commit_link}02a7b790[02a7b790])


* using name of pool for MemTracker setup added more traces in refcounting of pools ({ci_commit_link}9ba96fa2[9ba96fa2])

* tracing request URI ({ci_commit_link}c09b993b[c09b993b])


* tracing client info in ctor ({ci_commit_link}c38071da[c38071da])


* fixed bug in LDAPConnection: - do only a reconnect when LDAPConnectionManger says to do so - switched default behaviour from "RebindTimeout 3600" (do a rebind on all ldap connections administrated   by LDAPConnectionManger every hour to "RebindTimeout 0".   Rationale:   LDAPConnection stores a null LDAP connection handle when it encounters a  problem. Thus on the   the next call to LDAPConnectionManager::GetLdapConnection()  will return with "MustRebind".   LDAPConnection checks this value and does the rebind "behind the scenes" and stores the new (and valid)   ldap handle with LDAPConnectionManger::SetLdapConnection.   As a consequence, we have only one failed call, the call which encounters the ldap problem. This call will   fail regardless persistent ldap connections are used or not.   Because the mechanism is "self healing" we must not bother with Rebinds every n seconds. Nevertheles the RebindTimeout   may be useful if we have connections which are seldom used. Here the periodically Rebinds will prevent an eventually failure   when we want to use a probably timeout ldap connection. (closed / invalidated by the ldap server's timeout). added testcases ({ci_commit_link}078696e9[078696e9])


* config upgraded to 1.4 options ({ci_commit_link}b88ed9f5[b88ed9f5])


* fixed bug due to side effect of IntLookupSession:    The original session must be retrieved and saved before IntLookupSession is called. ({ci_commit_link}01aa657b[01aa657b])

* added WIN32 variant of SYBASE variable content ({ci_commit_link}a9446925[a9446925])


* added OutputMapper specifications for new SybCTnewDAImpl  - unfortunately Mappers are not derived from HierarchConf yet so every alias needs the same config over and over... ({ci_commit_link}58cebd85[58cebd85])


* adjusted existing config and added new ones for SybCTnewDAImpl ({ci_commit_link}0faea63c[0faea63c])

* added tests for SybCTDAImpl and SybCTnewDAImpl ({ci_commit_link}467dabdb[467dabdb])


* changed assertion from AssertAnyEqual to AssertAnyCompareEqual  - allows lazy check, position and content independent ({ci_commit_link}791d6101[791d6101])


* added new tests ({ci_commit_link}e18aeeca[e18aeeca])


* new set of DAImpls for Sybase access  - MT-safe (tested)  - connection will be kept open for a configurable amount of time  - connection will be re-used if already open and unused  - adapted to new Mappers and putting every single row to allow 'inline' processing (reformatting) of result ({ci_commit_link}cd29db47[cd29db47])


* corrected problem with multithreading  - this problem was present and undetected for a long time... -> re-enabling of MT-Tests for SybCTDAImpls showed the problem ({ci_commit_link}5aa06160[5aa06160])


* added initialization of SybCTnewDAImpls if defined in SybaseModule config  - other initializations are also slot dependant now ({ci_commit_link}24253840[24253840])

* added more traces ({ci_commit_link}02b351d1[02b351d1])


* storing ResultMappers name into ResultMapper.DestinationSlot  - this way round, we can always rely on the name in this slot to find the correct output slotname  - the name will be set before scheduling the real DoPut-method ({ci_commit_link}2a50a9b8[2a50a9b8])


* only urlEncoding state when it contains characters to encode again addede traces ({ci_commit_link}45f5ba97[45f5ba97])

* typesafe object list added  - wrapping code suggests usage as Queue ({ci_commit_link}e068d116[e068d116])


* Return false to HTTPProcessor::DoReadInput in *all* cases where RequestReader detected an error.   Current code version handled the error (logging and HTML-rendering) but returned "true". As a consequence,   the request was passed on to the framework. This created nasty side-effects, e.g:   - Request is faulty, RequestReader generates correct error reply   - Request is passed to the framework. Cookies are not  present, because RequestReader stopped reading after     the first erranous request header field.   - Because there are no cookies in the request, the login page is rendered and displayed by the browser. (Instead     of showding the expected error page. Added / refactored testcases ({ci_commit_link}5b896dc7[5b896dc7])

* corrected duplicate definition/usage of variables corrected WIN32 version of random ({ci_commit_link}9adde05b[9adde05b])


* added return type for ShutdownWriting changed some WIN32 specific things for testing ({ci_commit_link}aed46dbf[aed46dbf])


* added traces ({ci_commit_link}e8e1a7d4[e8e1a7d4])


* WIN32:  - added DLL interfaces for some classes  - fixed const array initialization ({ci_commit_link}0c7ef79c[0c7ef79c])

* fixed wrong dbg-Function name ({ci_commit_link}ff3ee8f3[ff3ee8f3])


* - scetched out calls for setting a ldap rebind callback. This works only for chasing     referals, but not for re-binding in case a ldap was shut down and restarted while we still     hold a "valid" ldap binding handle *!!   - because above approach does not work, the second best solution is:     If we own a invalid binding handle, the Wait4Result function returns with an error. In     this case we invalidate (set the handle to NULL) the handle in the LDAPConnectionManager     which forces a rebind the next time we uset this handle. *!! - fixed loop when synchronous ldap operation was requested and ldap server was shut     down while we still are holding a "valid" ldap binding handle   - Do a ldap_abandon in synchronous mode - MapUTF8 and ldap operation timeout are not needed to be parte of the unique id used by     LDAPConnection manager to correctly identify the binding handle - Eliminated duplicate code, factored into HandleWait4ResultError method - Introduced fUniqueId variable ({ci_commit_link}1f0bfbfa[1f0bfbfa])


* disabled traces ({ci_commit_link}e5a0dd6d[e5a0dd6d])


* "Persistent" LdapConnections These are the design rationales: - LDAP accesses happen within a thread. A thread usually cannot continue as long it has not read all or at least   part of the data returned form the LDAP server.     -> There is no benefit in adding an LDAP-Connection pool, but it will add complexity - The different LDAP "contextes" are highly dynamic and cannot be determined at bootstrap. An application e.g. will   decide at runtime what DN and BindPassword it will use to connect to the LDAP server.     -> Decide at the latest possible point (where the bind will take place) whether we have a LDAP connection ready which        will fit our needs. - Implement a lazy algorithm. If a worker thread wants to access the LDAP server, store the parameters needed to uniquely distinguish   the connections (Server,Port, DN, ConnectTimeout, RebindTimeout, UTF8Encoding, ThreadId) and allow the same thread to reuse   this connection. Only the connections *needed* are created and stored. - Allow transparent switching between pooled and not pooled accesses. TODO: - Find a mechanism to detect invalidated LDAP connections, e.g. when a LDAP server is restarted an we still hold a bind   handle. The current workaround of doing a rebind every n seconds may not be enough. - Use a MD5 hash to hash the uniquely distinguishable identifier - Added lots of TestCases ({ci_commit_link}bc8ba1d0[bc8ba1d0])


* added traces ({ci_commit_link}a0f10e4a[a0f10e4a])


* slightly refactored code set SSLClientSessionTimeout to 1 day set UseThreadLocalMemory for SSL and non-SSL connectors ({ci_commit_link}839848c5[839848c5])

* typo correction ({ci_commit_link}890e3fa0[890e3fa0])


* added option AppendAnyAlways to ResultMapper  - this option appends results always (anonymous slots)  - default behavior is: setting in the first call and appending for consecutive calls ({ci_commit_link}1e16247a[1e16247a])


* added url relevant rfc extract to document behavior of function ({ci_commit_link}d7cc02ce[d7cc02ce])

* adding flag NoCertAndPrivateKey ({ci_commit_link}dc593a3e[dc593a3e])


* using new SSLConnector interface ({ci_commit_link}78587b0c[78587b0c])


* allow multiple connects with a given connector.   This allowes session resumpition testing ({ci_commit_link}dc761032[dc761032])


* tidied up SSLConnector interface ({ci_commit_link}3e075837[3e075837])


* renamed testconfig slots ({ci_commit_link}72b75a06[72b75a06])


* added testcases ({ci_commit_link}f5941a58[f5941a58])


* added testcases for ssl session resupion   with minimal config ({ci_commit_link}b720436a[b720436a])


* new setting NoCertAndPrivateKey allows creation of   SSL_CTX without private key or cert.   (used if peer authentication is no issue) ({ci_commit_link}1886894a[1886894a])


* adjusted FindApplication interface  - can now be used in conjunction with Application::GetConfig() as config parameter ({ci_commit_link}32dcc56c[32dcc56c])


* extracted Method RenderFilterVal even if no cookies where present, fill in the /NrOfCookies structure (and set the counts to 0)   for the cookies we're interested in. switched returncode back to old semantics: true=cookies where sent, 0 no cookies where sent ({ci_commit_link}3e96bee9[3e96bee9])


* Handle multiple cookies with same name correct Method HandleCookies has same behaviour like before. Especially, HandleCookie does not stop if it   encounters an error, it works upon all defined cookie names and returns an over all returncode (true or false)   at the end of the method. This way, the good cookies are still available.     - If there ise more then one cookie having the same name, instead of storing  AnyArrayImpl a ""  value       is stored     - For every cookie specified, a structure as follows is stored in env: 	/NrOfCookies 	{ 	    "IamOk"		1 	    "MoreThenOne" 	4 	    "IDoNotExist"	0 	}       This structure may be used to deliver concise error messages to the user: 	- browser did not send cookie 	- browser sent more then one cookie with the same name, please delete your xy cookies Added test cases. ({ci_commit_link}f77ff96b[f77ff96b])


* added DoStartedHook  - will be called when os-thread could be allocated and started  - allocators are valid from here on so we can do specific things requiring allocators here ({ci_commit_link}f7bef9b4[f7bef9b4])


* added flag to suppress re-initialization (refresh) of allocator after each Working loop ({ci_commit_link}bb76a995[bb76a995])

* return NULL stream if handshake failure   (checked by the ssl layer, no app secific    checking involved) ({ci_commit_link}cfb7d46a[cfb7d46a])


* streamlined code ({ci_commit_link}bc497439[bc497439])


* this code contained three memory leaks, furthermore Strings where passed to ldap methods    deallocating memory, which could lead to core dumps. Fixed leak in: - retrieving the distinguished name 		  - releasing the attr structure 		  - releasing the retrieved values (this was done, but with the wrong call) changed String usage to plain char * usage where the char * must bee freed later on. These fixes  leads to reduced memory consumption in a login test doing 10'000 logins  of 200 MB(!) ({ci_commit_link}72dc448c[72dc448c])


* getuid() added ({ci_commit_link}bcd08342[bcd08342])


* issue log message removed not needed shutdown ({ci_commit_link}6165fc2b[6165fc2b])


* Fixing framework bugs: If webdisplay server establishes connections to peer and peer becomes unreachable   (due to crash, network interface down, routing problems) the worker threads having   established SSL connections (netstat ESTABLISHED) will wait for the default timeout   (5 minutes). Any timeout given / set will be ignored. This is a bug. Fix: a) Set timeout earlier in ProcessRequest, because GetStream() upon a SSL socket already does    i/o on the stream to do the SSL-handshake b) In SSLSocket::DoMakeStream pass the timeout to the SSLSocketStream. The current implementaion    does not pass a timeout and the default argument of 5 minutes is used. ({ci_commit_link}cb0c50d1[cb0c50d1])


* added (commented out) code which sets socket   to non blocking. ({ci_commit_link}ffc9a52a[ffc9a52a])


* changed default message to "Page not found." ({ci_commit_link}9d11ac2e[9d11ac2e])


* in the case a ldap connection was bad the WaitForResult method started spinning.   Fixed this behaviour for cases where timeout is not null, and a non blocking behaviour   with immediate return if stream is not good is expected ({ci_commit_link}e5719179[e5719179])

* note that HTTPProcessor and this class need some refactoring to factor the instance variables out   from these classes. I thing a HTTPProcessorInterface which gives access to the instance variables   might do the job, let's sse Monday. RequestReader logs now all events to SecurityLog, no more flags are passed to the application because   the logging is done entirely by RequestReader. Generate "bad request" pages without giving the cause why this happened Give fine tuned control over the request verification process Provide meaningful default (none of belwo settings must be given, defaults are applied) Added many testcases Added methods to query error state in HTTPPRocessor   The process is as follows:   - check URL for not encoded chars 		#! Specifies chars in a URL which are "safe" and must not be URL-encoded. 		#! A-Z, a-z, 0-9, are always good plus default save chars $-_.+/?% 		#! With this setting you override the deafault save chars! 	/CheckUrlEncodingOverride		""   - One-time or exhaustively decode the URL 	/UrlExhaustiveDecode	0 		#! Instead of rejecting the request,normalise the path (and re-encode the URL)   - Check the Url for RFC1738 unsafe chars 		#! Specifes what chars in a URL are considered unsafe. The default used is 		#! <>\"#%{}|\\^~[]`, you may override this with this setting. 	/CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeCharsOverride "" 		#! chars > 127 in a URL are considered unsafe (Ascii extended). Chars given 		#! with this setting are considered good, even when above 127. 	/CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeCharsAsciiOverride "" 		#! Decode a encdoed URL until no more escape sequences are present. 		#! If this setting is 0, there is only a one-time decoding step.   - Check for directory traversial attack 	/FixDirectoryTraversial 0 		#! If FixDirectoryTraversial is set, specify which chars are not url-encoded 		#! This is needed for old webdisplay backends 	/URLEncodeExclude		"/?" 		#! If URLEncodeExclude is set, you may specify which chars you don't want to 		   re-urlencode in a fixed url (because a directory traversial attach has been 		   detected). ({ci_commit_link}8689c544[8689c544])


* CheckUrlEncoding takes an override set of chars to check for. If nothing is given,   the default applies CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeChars:   - takes an override set of chars to check for   - takes a parameter triggering ascii extended char set check   - takes an override set of chars for the ascii extended check Added test cases ({ci_commit_link}a196eda8[a196eda8])


* ContainsOneAbove takes now   -the waterMark to check   -A string containing chars which are > the waterMark (e.g. > 127) but are excluded from checking.    E.g. invoking    ContainsOneAbove() reports position of first extended ascii char    ContainsOneAbove(127,"Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼") does the same, but ignores "Ã¤Ã¶u" contained the string    to check Added testcases ({ci_commit_link}61922fdd[61922fdd])


* added new parameter to Queue  - name: you have to specify the queues name in ctor to identify it in messages ({ci_commit_link}204da914[204da914])

* forgot to check in altered header file   which brok DailyBuildTests (:- ({ci_commit_link}08e6b9a2[08e6b9a2])


* added sanity check test ensuring a passed in   null-ptr ConfNamedObject does behave in such a way that lookups are only upon   the ROAnything and no lookups are done on the config, because this would segfault. ({ci_commit_link}787d0d09[787d0d09])


* ROAnyConfNamedObjectLookupAdapter looks into a ConfiguredNamedObject's config if the looked up   slot has not been found in the loooked-up Anything the ROAnythingLookupAdapter works on. ({ci_commit_link}bd4072e0[bd4072e0])


* Helper object extending ROAnyLookupAdapter. ROAnyConfNamedObjectLookupAdapter does a lookup in the ConfiguredNamedObject's   config if the lookup was not successful on the (RO)Anything the LooupAdapter works on.   You will use this object in those conditions where you don't have a context (and don't want pay the cost   constructing one)  but want to use a Anything overriding some values otherwise given in a ConfiguredNamedObject's config. ({ci_commit_link}72c8ecd0[72c8ecd0])


* test starter file ({ci_commit_link}75a3570e[75a3570e])

* *fixed shadowed variable ({ci_commit_link}10e29f12[10e29f12])


* removed not needed tracing ({ci_commit_link}a7e891dd[a7e891dd])


* fixed major wd2 SSL implementation memory leak   Pointer to X509 certificate was aquired twice.Getting the X509 cert increases a openssll internal   refcount, which is decremented on the X509_free call. Thus the refcount of the cert remained 1,   leaving the memory hole. ({ci_commit_link}3124b294[3124b294])


* fixed trace ({ci_commit_link}58881f33[58881f33])


* removed unused variable ({ci_commit_link}557ae056[557ae056])


* When Context is used with "copy session store" semantics, a copy of the session store is made and used   instead of the real session store by the context object.   This allows concurrent threads using their contextes without bothering about session locking, because lookups   aiming at the session store end up at the (read only) copy of the session store.   The problem with the old implementation was a DeepClone from global storage to global storage, instead of   doing a deep clone from global storage to thread local storage.   This has been fixed. ({ci_commit_link}5bcbb367[5bcbb367])


* SSLConnector and Connector may now be configured with an allocator. Most uses for the Connector object   take place entirely within a thread. Thus there is no ovious need to allocate global memory. This improves the   overall performance and reduces the memory footprint.   Especially we get rid of the expensive copies Storage::Global <-> Storage::Current.   For compatibility  reasons, the default is still Storage::Global(), but you can easily overwrite this default. Added testcases verifying that correct PoolAllocator is used Changed/adapted existing testcases did some minor fixing of testcases ({ci_commit_link}0bc8896b[0bc8896b])

    build files: cleanup and foundation target renames

    - instead of dotted foundation target names like CoastFoundation.Time
     we now use separate build files for each of the libraries and therefor
     changed the target name to a non dotted one like CoastFoundationTime
     -> this is relevant for all subparts of CoastFoundation but not the
        composed target which is still CoastFoundation

    SystemLog: added hook for console message formatter

    - SystemLog now provides an exchangeable console log formatter with
     the default implementation as before and an extended formatter which
     prefixes each console log message with a local time stamp.
    - enable the time stamp prefixed formatter by setting the env variable
     COAST_LOGONCERR_WITH_TIMESTAMP to 1

    ldap error messages can be suppressed from being logged to SystemLog

    changed Storage::SetHooks() to return the old hook and not the restored one

    the hook which is removed seemed more natural.

    implemented 'DeepClone' fix when Anything is used as internal container  -
    using template argument deduction to select ctor parameter type and
    internal storage type  -> using Anything reference semantics again instead
    of working on copies which could lead to DeepCloning when not needed  -
    ROAnything behavior is still the same

    corrected code to find valid config directory
    - find is not the best choice to search a local directory based on
    wildcards because it might descend and find a good match first

    changed way how to find config directory removed FINDOPT vars when testing
    for gnu tool, testing both names for being a gnu tool

    using shell expansion instead of find to get correct sniff project name

    added test if directory pattern to test is an existing one before selecting
    it

    quieting cd -

    prepending content of .ld-search-path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH if available

    unchanged, using local time. Added testcases



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Iterate from 0 to 255 instead from   0 to 255 since Apache 2.0.54 and 2.2.6

    modulo 256 sesssion,   2.2.6  does not resume the first session, but all
    following ones, which is correct   behaviour.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed dupliate declaration



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Call SetCount(0) on Mutex unlock and release countarray[fMutexId] slot.

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    crash-fixed eof/failbit code



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Fixed empty zipped file bug: Instead of immediately returning EOF after

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added tests for AMonth and AYear inner classes



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed YEAR constant from global scope because the number of seconds is
    tied to the real year  - use AYear inner class and AsSeconds to access this
    number instead added a class to do the same for month  - use AMonth inner
    class and AsSeconds to get the number of seconds for the specified month in
    a specific year



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    printing out test directory in case of a failure

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added DefaultAllocator definition disabled tracing of allocator-methods
    even in DBG mode  -> must be explicitly enabled by commenting

    slow down much compared against Storage::Current



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    std:allocator <-> WebDisplay Allocator wrapper  - allows to use our
    Allocator memory from within stl containers etc.

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    bug fix removed obsolete fields



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added feature to internally retrying DB command if it fails  - specify
    SybDBTries > 1 to execute query more than once if it fails force closing
    connection if command execution failed  - it seemes that not closing the
    broken connection will leave us in a non recoverable state sometimes



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added method to GetStringFromRetcode  - useful when trying to lock down a
    problem error logging improved by printing textual retcode



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    moved GetDestinationSlot from private to protected  - derived classes might
    wish to find out about their destination



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    InterruptHandler passes its pid to the Server writing the PIDFile  - this
    is needed on Linux because thread/process handling is different than on
    Solaris



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added thread number parameter to DoAllocThread method



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    more adjustments for the case we dont use an Anything as internal storage



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected PutBackElement when using std::list<> types



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    If /NoPoolManager is configured   BlockRequests() returns always   0 which
    indicates success. This allows   a BatchServer to be reset.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    printing time to wait in trace



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected date to test for



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    not needed anymore

    templateified QueueWorkingModule  - use AnyQueueWorkingModule for a
    predefined Anything/Anything combination module



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adapted to templateified Queue



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adapted to templateified Queue



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    templateified Queue to allow elements of any type to be stored, therefor
    the container type is also a template parameter  - element and container
    types can be different from Anything  - AnyQueueType is a predefined type
    for old Anything based Queue instances



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    gcc2.95 adaptions



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    (Simple)?MutexEntry/RWLockEntry changed to LockUnlockEntry  - as it is now
    template based, the class name is the same for all types. RWLocks
    reading/writing flag has changed to a specific enumeration value which
    makes things clearer LockedValueIncrementDecrementEntry, former CountEntry,
    was added to Threads.h  - it increments a given value reference when
    entering and decrements the value when leaving Mutex constructor now throws
    an exception when fgpMutexIdMutex was not initialized yet



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    new timings added



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    CountEntry changed to LockedValueIncrementDecrementEntry



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted ports of HIKU_INT(2)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added stl-container-conforming accessors that it can be used like
    std::list<> or other container-types  -> added specific test for these
    features corrected existing tests which compared string contents by using
    memcmp :-{



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added stl-container-conforming accessors that it can be used like
    std::list<> or other container-types  - iterators are available too



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed trace switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    correction of PrepareShutdown which is non-virtual anymore  ->
    DoPrepareShutdown needs to be overwritten instead



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added trace of pool config



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added some trace help by specifying this id



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    passing ThreadId when notifying observers



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed Run to GlobalRun



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    interface cleanup  - moved some methods to the private section



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    interface cleanup  - virtual specifier not needed



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    include cleanup



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed dependency to Server.h



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    non-virtual interface cleanup  - added many protected virtual DoXXX methods
    instead of having public virtual XXX methods



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    by adding NoPoolManager slot in (Master)Server.any and setting it to 1, the
    server framework can be used without using a
    ServerThreadPoolsManagerInterface conforming class  - this might be useful
    when no HTTP access is needed but PoolMemory for a server thread might make
    sense



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added AppLogModule::eLogLevel as additional parameter  - the severity level
    can be controlled per AppLogChannel



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added AppLogModule::eLogLevel as additional parameter  - the severity level
    can be controlled per AppLogChannel



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Log severity level AppLogChannel is now a registered object  - this
    allows to create specialized channels which can then be instantiated by
    finding them in the registry and Cloneing them  -> see TKSAppLogChannel



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed to using SimpleMutex/Condition Start method now checks more than
    before  - counts the threads which could really be started against the
    PoolSize  - waits until all Threads have started before continuing  - sets
    Thread->SetRunningState(eWorking) to have another way to synchronize their
    start, ignored by thread if not checked for Update also counts the Threads
    which terminated already  - this is needed in Start, not to wait on started
    Threads forever



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    sending SIGTERM to interrupt handler in dtor to forca its shutdown  -
    otherwise it would block in the sigwait() call

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    using namespace std; removed from headerfiles



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    saving results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added missing possibility to pass Start arguments to threads  - this can
    now be done by overriding DoGetStartConfig  -> DoGetConfig was renamed to
    DoGetInitConfig for init configuration



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added typedef to internal representation of time_t  - should be easier to
    change somewhen



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added typedef for BaseClassType using std::for_each algorithm instead of
    handcrafting a loop



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    make StreserThread's THRID() adjusted by an eventually passed in OFFSET=nn
    argument available   in environment. ("IdAndCurrentOffset")   This can be
    useful when userid's used in stress-tests are derived from the running
    thread's id   but must be adjusted for some reasons by an OFFSET.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Trace



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    extended stat test to see that IsXX methods are correct



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    extended/corrected CheckPath to return if path given is a symbolic link  -
    in case a path is a link pointing to either a directory or file, the
    st_mode member could not be used anymore to find this out when using only
    lstat  -> now a call to both lstat and stat will be done to be more
    specific and correct again



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added system trace switch



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    twice



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed return types of Directory related methods added new methods dealing
    with symlinks  - tests missing but will follow soon adjusted testcases

    allocation/use of mutexcountarray optimized



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted tests to to moved DoubleToString conversion method



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added DoubleToString conversion method as static class member int and
    double to string conversion can be selected from either using iostram based
    conversion (which potentially creates locks) or snprintf based conversion 
    - set compiler flag IOSTREAM_NUM_CONVERSION if you want to use iostream
    based conversion, otherwise snprintf conversion will be used



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed to using DoubleToString conversion of String



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    re-moved DoubleToString conversion method to String double and long
    conversions will be delegated to String

    config   every LogAll() call



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Speed refactoring, use class instance vars



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    This file is identical with version 1.41   Versions 1.42 until 1.43 are
    kept to make them   still available



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    This version is equal to version 1.79 Versions 1.80 until 1.81 not deleted
    to make them still available



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Avoid DeepClone() if ROAnything is passed

    added/changed switch settings



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Terminate call in destructor to cleanup



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    old session was not unlocked in InitSession() when fUnlockSession was false
    (default)  - this lead to mutex destruction errors because the mutex was
    still in use when deleting such sessions



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added ServerThread::CheckState(eTerminated) before destructing it methods
    which were called on server get now called on ServerThread



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added error message when pool was still in use



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added lock when ServerThread gets shutdown  - unfortunately there is no way
    yet to be sure that the PrepareShutdown exited before
    DoTerminatedRunMethodHook gets called  -> this could lead to undefined
    behavior



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected returned error code



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted time measurement test



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected cleanup of thread resources added additional mutex macro param



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    code  - this return code can be useful in determining the real problem



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted appending of syserr-message



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added trace switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    testcases extended to prove the functionality of AliasInstaller



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more checks for alias installer specifications  - an empty alias name
    lead to coredumps when shutting down  - specific messages get printed when
    a misconfiguration gets detected



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted copying defaults

    will only change mode of config and script files if they were enabled to
    copy

    added options to test what script would do
    - -n test mode, show what would get deleted
    - -i to ask for each deletion



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected range processing when negative tokens were specified



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added testcase to prove working of StringTokenizeRenderer when a negative
    range was specified like /RenderTokens "-4--1"



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    definition of limit values only needed on linux for gcc < 4



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    fixed typo



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted tests which use MemTracker specific knowledge  - some of them work
    only if TRACE_STORAGE is set to a certain level



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    MemTracker will only get created when TRACE_STORAGE >= 1



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    hardened test condition



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added some results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted test due to variable name changes added two tests to show behavior
    of ExcessMemory allocation and splitting larger blocks



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted tests which use MemTracker specific knowledge  - some of them work
    only if TRACE_STORAGE is set to a certain level



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    re-enabled tests of excess tracker depending on the TRACE_STORAGE level



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted description of bucket sizes parameter hopefully for the last time 
    - I changed the comment to mention the usable size of specific buckets
    which is 8192bytes when NumOfPoolBucketSizes is set to 10  -> now the
    usable size on linux and solaris is the same, unfortunately the
    MemoryHeader::AlignedSize() differed so that some tests did fail on some
    platforms



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more test results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted description of bucket sizes parameter hopefully for the last time 
    - I changed the comment to mention the usable size of specific buckets
    which is 8192bytes when NumOfPoolBucketSizes is set to 10  -> now the
    usable size on linux and solaris is the same, unfortunately the
    MemoryHeader::AlignedSize() differed so that some tests did fail on some
    platforms splitting a larger bucket into smaller ones when requesting more
    buckets in a fully used pool will not work nicely anymore because the next
    larger bucket is double in payload size but this will not allow two smaller
    buckets (payload+MemoryHeaderSize) to fit  - as this can be avoided by
    specifying enough poolmemory, I see no problem in having changed this
    behavior tracking statistics can be enabled by setting TRACE_STORAGE
    appropriately -> see Storage::fglStatisticLevel  - the only performance
    drawback when disabled is comparing a pointer value optimized calling
    locations of TrackAlloc/TrackFree



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    used bucket tracking now only works for pooled buckets  - this reduces
    overhead for GlobalAllocator which does not use bucket counting removed
    unused MemTracker::Init() method



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    renamed usable size variable to clarify when using it



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    tracing of used blocks can now be enabled by setting TRACE_STORAGE=3
    renamed of MemoryHeader variable improved used block dump output format



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    extended TRACE_STORAGE levels to 3  - 3: trace memory blocks which were
    still in use when freeing Allocator



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    MemChecker will only print out when memory was consumed and not freed
    MemTracker will only get created when TRACE_STORAGE >=1 added
    Storage::Initialize() before creating GlobalAllocator to have a correct
    value in GetStatisticLevel()



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adde method to get statistic level which gets initialized by the value of
    TRACE_STORAGE environment variable  - see also documentation of
    fglStatisticLevel



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted block size comment for NumOfPoolBuckets



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed ServerName string to be on Global storage



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added some MT_Storage switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added new state transition state eStartInProgress which is not activated
    currently  - prepared variable to store arguments passed in Start() for
    later call to DoStartedHook()



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed default of fRefreshAllocator to false



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed TrackAlloc/TrackFree interfaces added Storage::Global() modifiers
    to some Mutexes



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    using Storage::Global() for SimpleMutex



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added new test for MemTracker



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    applied type conversion to ctor values due to explicit constructors in
    TimeStamp



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected SizeHint tests



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added MemTrackerTest



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added test to see if memory blocks in use get dumped to stderr (optical
    test...)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Allocator parameter to constructors and static methods  - allows
    allocation of the internally used string buffer in the correct memory
    location changed two of the constructors to explicit, eg. you need to
    specify the correct type when wanting to use it



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added getters for internal values modified the TrackAlloc/TrackFree
    interface to take a MemoryHeader* instead of just the memory size used  -
    allows tracking of used blocks which then can be used to dump the still
    allocated blocks of memory



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed the minimal allocation block size to 32 as if we allocate a 16byte
    block of memory, all the space would get used by the MemoryHeader  - if 32
    is the smallest size, we would get 16bytes of MemoryHeader and 16bytes to
    use for the caller changed direct member access to using getters added
    methods to DumpStillAllocated memory blocks

    removed tight coupling of Server to SessionListManager  - ideally spoken,
    the SLM Module should manage its behavior only! changed MasterServer part
    dealing with ServerThreads to be able to use PoolMemory for the controlled
    Server instance  - Init/Terminate of controlled Server instance will be
    called in DoStartedHook and DoTerminatedRunMethodHook respectively   > this
    allows usage of PoolAllocator memory for Server instance beginning from
    Init   > specify UsePoolStorage/PoolStorageSize/NumOfPoolBucketSizes in
    server specific entry within /ServerModules {} config trying to delete
    PIDFile only if it got created through the server

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    more results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    semaphore count test hardened  - due to the fact that we can not know how

    changed CacheHandlerMutexAllocator priority removed termination message



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    calling MT_Storage::UnregisterThread() in CleanupThread  - more safety
    concerning thread cleanup and destruction using ThreadId instead of
    thread-address as PoolAllocator id now, easier to match



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added some traces tracing pool bucket in case it was not freed when
    terminating



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Finis() method to WorkerPoolManager which does pool cleanup  - should
    be used to cleanup pool before destroying it



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added UnregisterThread() method to remove threads Allocator from its
    ThreadLocalStorage



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted switch



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    content-length now also gets set when using non-mmap streams  - this now

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more test results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added evalutation of RUN_ATTACHED_TO_GDB variable  - this flag can be
    specified within prjconfig.sh instead of specifying the -d option

    added another default entry to be used when a server should be run under
    control of gdb
    - this is useful if the server crashes unexpectedly and can not be started
    using startwds.sh -d

    corrected gdb parameters



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    macrofied setconcurrency and sigsetmask



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    releasing correct thread resource



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    GetSemaCount test enabled for all platforms



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed threading on Solaris to pthreads releasing thread resources in
    Exit() method  -> will not increase thread resource count in top anymore
    (solaris)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed threading on Solaris to pthreads added macros for defining
    GETSEMACOUNT, THRSIGSETMASK



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    when 'delete other configs' was specified, initial switching of
    prjconfig.sh should not remove other configs yet  - otherwise, alias rules
    might lead to nonsense



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    more timings added



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected format specifier according to used type



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added default flag entries for MMAP stream control and Storage tracing



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    performance fix for PoolAllocators MemTrackers  - as PoolAllocators should
    only be used by one thread at a time, we should not create a MT_MemTracker
    but use a MemTracker instead



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added shell function to get out the value of an environment variable being
    set from within a script file

    added new service/server controlling feature using RUN_SERVICE variable
    - this variable will get evaluated whenever starting/stopping a server, if
    not specified the service will always get started as it was before this
    change
    - if the value of this variable is set to 0, the server will not get
    started and an appropriate message will get printed
    -> as you can see in the default prjconfig.sh of the scripts project, the
    intent is to have the services running on a specific host being specified
    in a single file

    improved output messages when not executing script due to RUN_SERVICE=0
    setting



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added printout of servers pid when starting

    corrected printf format specifier



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more statistics



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    replaced CheckConfig with Initialize method  - initialization of a
    configured object has two steps   - 1. load config if there is any   - 2.
    initialize object based on config if needed -> DoInitialize()  - in
    termination, Finalize() will be called   - DoFinalize() can be used to
    specialize termination for an object

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added feature to track size of pool/excess-memory used to be able to adjust
    PoolAllocator params according to real used memory statistics MemTrackers
    enabled regardless of compilation mode (removed MEM_DEBUG define)  - use
    TRACE_STORAGE flag with one of these values to control level of output:  -
    0: (default) No pool statistic tracing, except when excess memory was used 
    - 1: Trace overall statistics  - 2: Trace detailed statistics



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    MemTrackers enabled regardless of compilation mode (removed MEM_DEBUG
    define)  - use TRACE_STORAGE flag with one of these values to control level

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added tests for assertCompare



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added new assert Macro assertCompare[m] which prints values in case of
    non-success  - allows comparison of values with either one of
    [equal_to|not_equal_to|less|less_equal|greater|greater_equal] specifiers  -
    instead of t_assert(x<y), use assertCompare(x, less, y)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added TString::Append methods for different long-types  - changed sprintf
    to snprintf



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed warning that file cannot be loaded into info



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    persisting test results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    code reading improvements to check why a String::Append could fail on

    in Queue  -> see Queue for more details



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted some trace switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    improved handling of return codes  - added StatusCode enumerator which
    carries more information than just a bool  -> in case a Put/Get call was
    successful, Queue::eSuccess will be returned, other codes otherwise Both
    sides of the queue can be un-/blocked individually  - this allows blocking
    the Put side for example, while still emptying the queue using Get calls 
    -> allows easier implementations of termination sequences



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Beautyfied code.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Generate a unique id. Added testcases

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added rotator-termination timeout not to wait on termination infinitely



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    correction of signal handling  - when starting a multithreaded application,
    signal handling must be blocked for all threads, except the one to handle
    signals, because the signal mask will be inherited the signal handler must
    be the sole instance allowing to handle all needed signals



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added timings



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    test condition will also succeed when second run time is equal to the first

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted settings



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    TerminateChild will not recursively call itself until the child is dead  -
    it will loop and wat some microseconds after each try adjusted execve
    section a bit to clarify behavior



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    if source/dest did overlap in memcopy,   the resulting string was
    corrupted. Added tests



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed setting of LD_RUN_PATH to reduce 'hardcoded' references to
    directories



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    fixed subtle bug when string's length   is 0, then not only the memory for 
     the chars to fill has to be reserved...   After memcpying the fill chars
    to their destination   the Strings length has to be incremented up to the
    number   of filled in chars.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted old config_ files to new init/finis methods



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    retry interrupted system call in accept()



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    refactored and simplyfied code, it did not   like my own writing...



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed LD_ASSUME_KERNEL because it does not solve the GLIBC problem on all
    Linux systems  - instead, you need a set of 'old' glibc libraries to use
    for starting these non-conforming applications  -> see sniff_wrapper script
    to see how it is done



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added some statistics of cons



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more test results



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed illegal class specifier for method in class declaration (gcc >=
    4.1)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Ooops, PerpendWith core dumped when String has length 0.   Fixed and added
    testcase!



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    PrependWith: changed returntype from String& to bool, indicating whether
    some filling   took place



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added PrependWith method.   Prepends the String with given char until it
    has reached newLen.   If passed in (desired) newLen is smaller than the
    Strings length   the method is a no-op. added Testcase



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Corrected background of MultiFunctionListBoxRenderer



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    handle multiple COOKIE: lines correctly   see RFC2965, RFC2616 added tests



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Although inccorrect according to   "Errata to RFC 2965, HTTP State
    Management"   COOKIE: headers like this are created by FireFox & IE  
    COOKIE: mycookie1=value1; mycookie2=sessionid=4,lang=de,color=blue; ....  
    MIMEHeader first split the string by , which is correct according to  
    RFC2965. For cookies, the separator is ; and the procedure has to be   the
    following:   Split cookie string by ;   Normalize the string (remove
    leading/trailing blanks etc)   Split the string by key/values   Assign the
    result to fHeader["COOKIE"]



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    interpreted in century 19, others in century 20



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed II-hour option  - is now the same as HH specifier



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    refactoring and bugfixing  - numbers like month or day had always to be two
    digits long, which was in fact a bit stupid, because the first of the month
    is just one digit  - parsing of input string is more flexible now



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added ComputeDateRenderer trace entries



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    GetElement takes additional bTryLock parameter   This allows callers who
    don't want to block on a empty queue   to use the  "TryLock" (sort of
    peeking) feature already implemented   in the underlying Queue abstraction.
    The default is set to false, thus not disturbing existing code   Added
    testcase



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    renamed Work() method to Enter() which is the method used in PoolManagers  
    to dispatch the workload. (Made naming more consistent)

    Start and Length slot can be Rendererspecs now



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added new options to renderer  - DeltaGMTSeconds: if set to true, it will
    output the gmt to localtime offset in seconds  - UseLocalTime: if set to
    false, gmt time will be used for the output date instead of localtime



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added default value for IndexSlot name



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    extended optional Offset param  - seconds offset is the new default, day
    offsets must now be specified using a trailing 'd'



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added optional parameter to add a time offset  - second and day offsets are
    possible



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed return type of GetStream to PipeStream  - allows controlling of
    TimeOut setting from callers point of view



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed include of unistd.h  - included by System.h already



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    make GetPid() a public method



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Check if server termination is requested by signal (SIGINT) Use to
    distinguish between server reset and server termination. Returns true if
    termination was requested Returns false in all other cases, including
    server reset (SIGHUP)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed warning to info

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected trace name



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed build platforms to opt-wddbg instead of dbg  - first of all, on
    ftan, dbg-compilation leads to undeterministic behavior of library
    loading??  - as we use opt-wddbg most of the development time, I think it
    makes sense to have this setting tested in favour of the seldomly used dbg
    setting



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    fixed tracing



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Improved tracing ( InitFinisManager and derived objects have a name )

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    RotateSpecificLogChannel rotates now the log file even if   the
    /DoNotRotate flag was set in the log channel definition.   (It makes sense
    that if an application explicitly wants to rotate   a log file it should be
    done) Added testcases

    templatized streams  - internal buffer handling, copy or reference should
    be more clear now  - refactoerd in/out specific classes into one, generated
    finally depending on given buffer type



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    moved type specific things to separate file



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    templatized type helpers



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    constified value accessors



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected mode settings for streams opened using ios::ate  - the standard
    says not to create a file if it does not exist, reality is somehow
    different...



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed type of stream mode to appropriate type depending on system and
    compiler  - see header file corrected mode settings for streams opened
    using ios::ate  - the standard says not to create a file if it does not
    exist, reality is somehow different... made selection of stream type in
    OpenStream depending on environment variable WD_USE_MMAP_STREAMS  - default
    is to use memory mapped streams if supported  - set variable to 0 to use
    fstream instead



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed unused code



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    tests with dll and module loading to initialize all registered objects
    needed for tests



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    needed to add ServersModule to initialize Application-objects config



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted tests due to ConfNamedObject/WDModule/Registry changes  - added
    <object>->Initialize(category) where needed  - changed tests to configured

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed Finis in dtor



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    a server can be re-initialized and re-configured including associated pools
    or acceptors

    security items get configured even if no SecurityItems slot was configured



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    policies were adjusted where needed



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed implicit checkconfig calls



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    loading of object config gets postponed now until a corresponding WDModule
    initializes the registered objects  - this was needed because the static
    object initialization sequence and thus the use of the underlying
    CacheHandler::Get method was not controllable -> as side effect, it might
    be needed to add modules to the /Modules section of the application or
    tests configuration!



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed unused old cleaner code added some traces which is safe now



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    cachehandler gets its global mutex allocated by a specific InitFinisManager
    dependant now  - this solves spurios accesses to the Get method before
    properly initialized



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed termination of SysLog  - this is now done in the correct place



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    wdbase specific InitFinisManager



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted thread names



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    simplified Thread-id handling by using SimpleMutex implemented
    initialization using InitFinisManager corrected re-use implementation of
    thread  - this was not safe before because setting the thread to terminated
    could occur after the thread was re-aquired to use again



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    modified memtracker/allocator to have a unique id for tracing adjusted
    StorageHooks related things

    added #define to enable/disable memory mapped streams



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    allow LogMsgSizeHint for the string receiving the message to be logged  
    /LogMsgSizeHint, defaults to 128 bytes allow to circumvent rendering. If
    /Rendering 0 is set, a slot named   after the LogChannel is expected to be
    present in TmpStore. added testcases



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    compiler warning removal



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    of a log channel re-added SysLog include in AppLog.cpp added TestCase



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected gcc2.95.x build failure  - friend declaration must occur after
    inner class declaration



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    error correction in RotateTime calculation  - due to a mix-up of hour and
    minute, the rotation second was not initialized correctly  -> this lead to
    never-rotated logfiles again... added testcases to explicitly check for
    RotateTime settings now



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more tests to prove behavior



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected error when list to process was empty  - due to added start/end
    feature, the case when start=0 and listsize=0 lead to a false exit because
    start should not be greater than listsize  -> corrected this error and
    added shortcut exit in case the list is empty



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed direct TmpStore accesses to context.Lookup



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    If no /Header format is given, don't write (blank) header line. If
    SuppressEmptyLines is set and an empty file is logged, Log() should  
    return true, not false. (And this it does by now). Added the missing tests
    for the /SupressEmptyLines behaviour and added test for   Header line
    format spec not given.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added popping of temporarily pushed LookupInterface



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    cosmetic updates



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    major Push/Pop refactoring  - PushPopEntry refactored to use an internally
    created LookupInterface instead of attaching to the internal fStack
    Anything  -> this allows the use of ROAnythings for lookups too  ->
    sequence of looking up the different stores remains the same doxygen
    documentation adjusted



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    successor to ROAnyLookupAdapter  - improved, that it can serve for both
    Anything and ROAnything  - added base key param to emulate nesting in
    LookupPath semantics



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more trace switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added TestCase to check behavior of LogRotator



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    logfiles will be rotated again  - due to a wrong CheckState param, the
    logrotator got blocked until program restart new option RotateSecond  -
    instead of specifying hh:mm[:ss], the second in the day can be given new
    Channel-Option DoNotRotate  - if set to 1, the channel will not rotate its
    logfile



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    error correction for stores/slots not in same allocator  - slots were not
    removed when the caller got called from a different allocator-storage   
    this is due to the fact that an Anything copies itself when it detects the
    assignee to have a different allocator  -> this can be solved using a
    reference to the store, but care must be taken not to change the
    entry-reference to point to somewhere else



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more trace entries



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    moved RemoveAction up to other TmpStore operations

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted file header



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added non-virtual-interface for ConfiguredClone  - virtual method is
    DoConfiguredClone  -> this allows derived classes to create configured
    object hierarchies before CheckConfig gets called  --> this is important
    for HierarchConfNamed objects where base class DoLookup will be called when
    no object specific config is found corrected object hierarchy creation in
    HierarchConfNamed  - fSuper was used in (Do)ConfiguredClone call where this
    was needed!



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added non-virtual-interface for ConfiguredClone  - virtual method is
    DoConfiguredClone  -> this allows derived classes to create configured
    object hierarchies before CheckConfig gets called  --> this is important

    no object specific config is found

    HierarchConfNamed:  - removed two CheckConfig calls which were unnecessary



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected syslog test



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    apply path cleaning on config directory

    added config switches to control copy behavior
    - project specific can be applied using prjconfig.sh
    - cfg_do[Bin|Lib|Cfg|Log|Scr] allow enabling/disabling of copying
    corresponding directories from project to destination directory
     -> example usage can be found in scripts project where these flags are
    used to only copy the scripts itself without any substructure

    configured to build distribution package of scripts
    - also shows example usage of flags controlling cpall.sh

    refactored section collecting directories to apply config switching

    removed debug message

    added eagerness when looking for a TARGZNAME to install
    - this eliminates the need to define TARGZNAME in prjconfig.sh in case
    SERVERNAME is explicitly set

    made creation of log/rotate directory dependant on cfg_doLog flag

    corrected project path setting when we start relative

    adjusted setting of relative pathname



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    XXX temporarily disabled tests due to INT2 defect XXX

    a per query basis



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    arithmetic expressions using $(( )) does not work in regular shell  -
    replaced using expr program

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted trace switches



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted return codes of result limiting tests



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    result size limitation using MaxResultSize or MaxRows will not lead to a
    failing DataAccess anymore  - this was changed because the user is aware of
    this behavior and maybe wants to process the limited results anyways



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added tests for param SybDBMaxRows



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added new parameter to limit rows to be retrieved SybDBMaxRows

    correctly now  - <?xml tag will be recognized now



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    prconfigured policy typedefs



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    small changes



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Initial step of TestCase refactoring  - added policy to control config
    loading  - added policy to control statistic catching  -> anything based
    implementations can be found in project testfwFoundation which will be
    added in the next commits  -> see FoundationTestTypes.h for preconfigured
    types of available tests so far expect additional policies to come for:  -
    dll-loading  - module-loading and initialization



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed trace settings



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted code due to move of IsCertCheckPassed()   method from SSLConnector
    to SSLSocket



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted testcases due to move of IsCertCheckPassed()   method from
    SSLConnector to SSLSocket



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Moved IsCertCheckPassed method from SSLConnector to SSLSocket. The
    framework's ssl implementation   provides support for server and client
    sockets. (All needed data to perform the checks done by  
    IsCertCheckPassed() is prepared and placed in the Ctx and sockets's
    ClientInfo and SSLParameters   object).   Because cert checking can be done
    on *server* and client sockets, the IsCertCheckPassed method must   be
    moved to the Sockets interface. So far the method was only available from a
    SSLConnector object and   therefore restricted to client sockets.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    implemented Role into Params of Url to change role by server change

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added config params Delim and IndexDelim for cases where default behavior
    is not wanted adjusted doxygen comments changed all Get/Put methods to be
    non-virtual  - only DoXXX methods need to be virtual moved all DoXXX
    methods to protected section  - implication was that I needed to add a
    bunch of friends  -> friends must be eliminated in future!



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added config params Delim and IndexDelim for cases where default behavior
    is not wanted optimized SlotFinder::Operate to use non-Anything param

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    - unnessecary Trace removed



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    replaced AppendAnyAlways with appropriate PutPolicy



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    replaced AppendAnyAlways with PutPolicy  - policy values are Put and
    Append, the default behavior still remains the same  - Put mode does always
    replace an existing value  - Append always puts values into an array



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    corrected file rotating when terminating AppLog  - files were accidentally
    rotated during module termination



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    merged in changes between cvs_head repository



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted IP-Address



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    FileLoadRenderer renders error message like "file not found" directly   to
    the stream which for most usages is what we want becaus that way   it
    becomes obious that something is misconfigured.   However sometimes we
    don't want an error message rendered. The new switch   /Quiet "yes"
    (default is "no") just allows this. Added test cases



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    - added Result trace, result is better to read while testing

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    scripts of navigation buttons should be inserted at correct location now  -
    depending on button rendering, the scripts should be rendered either inside
    a <td> tag or standalone removed HidePrintButton  - use /PrintButton * to
    achieve tha same



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed processing of input stream  - the first part is to read the whole
    stream into a string buffer  - after the buffer was successfully read,
    anything conversion gets done  -> this could slow down the conversion
    process but offers better status and trace handling



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removing directories generated for test



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    dependencies  - added separate type to distinguish Impls postfix to prefix
    increment optimization



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    prepared for extensible comparers



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    postfix to prefix increment optimization



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed duplicated Scrambler entry



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    GetASessionsInfo pushes the session for which the session info is retrieved
    on the context.   Side effect: The old session (the session the actual
    request is made) is dereferenced, which   makes the session vulnerable to a
    deletion by the session cleaner.   In practice this does not happen
    because:   - Internal pages are rendered locked, thus the session is "busy"
    and will not be removed   - The customer timeout is longer then it takes to
    fulfill the session info query Nevertheless, the behaviour is flawed and
    has been fixed:   - Increment RefCount of session stored in ctx when
    session stored in ctx is unequal the one GetASessionsInfo queries   -
    Decrement RefCount of session stored in ctx when done Added testcase Added
    debug info



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Following the guidelines in  
    http://www.mozilla.org/directory/csdk-docs/threaded.htm#set_thread_structure
      the access to the errno variable has to be made thread safe.   if
    compiled with the threads option errno is a macro using thread specific
    memory   and making sure that every thread has it's own instance off errno.
      Since we cannot konw how "our" libldap was compiled, the ldap sdk offers
    some   hook methods to wrap the call to errno. Because errno is called
    within a callback   which *we* compile, the right thread safe errno macro
    will be expanded and compiled. Fixed testcases



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed using directive because of problems with older compilers



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    in the top pushed element



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added using directive to avoid DoTest shadowing

    MakePoolAllocator using poolid=0  - forces assignment of ThreadId as PoolId



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed Trace in dtor of CleanupInitializer setting allocator Id to
    ThreadId in case the allocator has Id==0  - should simplify identification
    of PoolStorage



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    made dtor of CleanupHandler virtual



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    modified MT_Storage and MTStorageHooks  - using FinalCleaner class for
    clean shutdown corrected cleanup error where also the GlobalStorage was
    deleted



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    made StorageHooks a class simplified initialization/termination of Storage 
    - using FinalCleaner as base for this SetHooks now calls the StorageHooks
    Initialize/Finalize methods



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed obsolete Storage::SetHooks(0)



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    enhanced SlotPutter and SlotCleaner with simple parameter interface added

    Changed behaviour of HttpFlowController when cookies wit no domain are
    preset in the   incoming request. In this case the best thing that can be
    done is to assign all these   cookies to the same domain. (Code already
    contained a statement doing this for ports   80/443, but it should be done
    for all ports. Removed dead wood HttpFlowController handles redirects based
    upon:   meta tag "refresh"   and new   location: headerfield

    If /LDAPTryAutoRebind and within a AutoRebind sequence happened another
    error this   connections was never releasead and thus the counting sema was

    completely refactored persistent ldap connections. the maximum number of
    connections per connection pool may be specified on the fly retry option if
    ldap connection becomes bad problem of running out of filehandles seems to

    adjusted documentation



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added more tests to ensure header field access



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    correctly implemented header field getting now added virtual function to
    access Header information  - wraps access because in IStream we need to
    zipinit() before being able to access header information



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added Pipe tracing switch



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    use Mutex instead of RWLock because lookups (so far protected with
    read-RWLocks)   into the global Anythings used to store SSLCtx and
    SSLSessions   change the Anything when a slot is not present.   The
    assumption that the Anything itself is a immutable object would hold true  
    only if all required slots would be initialised at module bootup, which is
    not   possible because we don't know the thread id's then. Fixed code where
    an object exposed to multithreaded accesses was not locked.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    camel cased lookup value for analyseReply

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Implemented ZipStream according to RFC1952  - filename, comment and other
    special features are fully handled  - ExtraField handling is limited to
    receiving the buffer only



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added ConversionUtils  - simple method added for buffer to value conversion
     - also contains buffer tracing helper

    refactored code, decoupled methods in order to make them orthogonal
    Although not neccessary from the HTTP state transmission protocol's
    viewpoint (RFC2965) which suggests that   servers use the set-cookie header
    and clients (browsers) respond with a cookie: headerfield when they are
    willing   to return the cookie, the MIMEHeader code is changed in such a
    way that:   - If the MIMEHeader class  recieves set-cookie header fields,
    instead of building one header field   set-cookie: akey=avalue;,
    bkey=bvalue;   it generates a structure of the form   /set-cookie   {    
    "akey=avalue"     "bkey=bvalue"   }   which allows HTTPHeaderRenderer to
    generate set-cookie   headers of the form   set-cookie: akey=avalue  
    set-cookie: bkey=bvalue added testcases

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Render set-cookie field not as rfc2965 suggests:   set-cookie:
    akey=avalue;, bkey=bvalue   Instead emit for each key=value pair a
    headerfield entry in the request header:   set-cookie: akey=avalue  
    set-cookie: bkey=bvalue   Browsers support only this syntax. Note:
    set-cookie2 is not supported by most browsers. Only opera seems to support
    this header field.

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    further 'cleanup' of Mappers  - the DestinationSlot entry will be entered
    into TmpStore after the last Put call  - this allows subsequent mappers to
    override the slot with other content but letting the first name remain in
    context after call added temporary overriding api for some special mappers



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    force the stream to be flushed by using separate scope

    reviewed tracing and changed to Stat trace where it seemed appropriate  -
    this should eliminate Pool memory being allocated when a PoolAllocator

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed some StartTrace to StatTrace to reduce potential storage problems

    WorkerThread:  - removed DoReadyHook method which was used to notify the
    PoolManager and to refresh Allocator  -- the pointer to WorkerPoolManager
    was removed entirely because it was bad practice  -- refreshing allocator
    moved to Run method because doing it in DoReadyHook could fill pool memory
    again with traces...  - Init method equal to Thread Init WorkerPoolManager 
    - deriving from Observer to receive Threads notifications  -- this is used
    to track WorkerThread transitions from Ready<->Working



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    removed unused ifdef



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added allocator parameter for StatTrace macros  - this is needed because
    the underlying debugging interface requires this    this behavior is needed
    because we mainly use Storage::Current() but for static tracing we could
    use Storage::Global() not to influence Allocator statistics



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    using new MemTrack macros for printing statistics



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added macro definitions for printing out tracker statistics  - conditional
    macro added to print only when something was allocated using the Allocator



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    fixed path to hashed certs dir



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Trace changes:  - changed everything from 'locking' Storage::Global() to
    Storage::Current()  -> this had some consequences in Threading but these
    locations are fixed now  -> also notice the new Allocator* param in static
    trace macros  - did some optimization in storing char* values where
    possible



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    adjusted some traces



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    WIN32 specific adjustment of new ThreadState



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    format of Thread::BroadcastEvt changed  - instead of a single
    unidentifieable value I added following structure:    /RunningState { /Old
    ? /New ? }    /ThreadState { /Old ? /New ? }



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed termination state handling  - Thread::eTerminated will now be set
    when IntRun() method returns, it was right after Run() returned before  -
    to be notified of a finished Run() method call I added
    Thread::eTerminatedRunMethod which is semantically identical to
    Thread::eTerminated before  -> the old behavior was especially bad when a
    thread was used with PoolAllocators and tracing enabled. This resulted in
    situations where IntRun() still had some trace memory allocated     but the
    corresponding PoolAllocator already scheduled for deletion! This was the
    evil time of core dumps...  - to be really sure that traces do not occupy
    memory anymore I also added a wait loop in ~AllocUnref to come around the
    problem of potential allocated trace memory in (Simple)Mutex traces
    CleanupThreadStorage also moved out to THREADWRAPPERFUNC



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    fixed bug in LDAPConnection: - do only a reconnect when
    LDAPConnectionManger says to do so - switched default behaviour from
    "RebindTimeout 3600" (do a rebind on all ldap connections administrated  
    by LDAPConnectionManger every hour to "RebindTimeout 0".   Rationale:  
    LDAPConnection stores a null LDAP connection handle when it encounters a 
    problem. Thus on the   the next call to
    LDAPConnectionManager::GetLdapConnection()  will return with "MustRebind". 
     LDAPConnection checks this value and does the rebind "behind the scenes"
    and stores the new (and valid)   ldap handle with
    LDAPConnectionManger::SetLdapConnection.   As a consequence, we have only
    one failed call, the call which encounters the ldap problem. This call will
      fail regardless persistent ldap connections are used or not.   Because
    the mechanism is "self healing" we must not bother with Rebinds every n
    seconds. Nevertheles the RebindTimeout   may be useful if we have
    connections which are seldom used. Here the periodically Rebinds will
    prevent an eventually failure   when we want to use a probably timeout ldap
    connection. (closed / invalidated by the ldap server's timeout). added
    testcases

    every single row to allow 'inline' processing (reformatting) of result



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    - scetched out calls for setting a ldap rebind callback. This works only
    for chasing     referals, but not for re-binding in case a ldap was shut
    down and restarted while we still     hold a "valid" ldap binding handle
    *!!   - because above approach does not work, the second best solution is: 
       If we own a invalid binding handle, the Wait4Result function returns
    with an error. In     this case we invalidate (set the handle to NULL) the
    handle in the LDAPConnectionManager     which forces a rebind the next time
    we uset this handle. *!! - fixed loop when synchronous ldap operation was
    requested and ldap server was shut     down while we still are holding a
    "valid" ldap binding handle   - Do a ldap_abandon in synchronous mode -
    MapUTF8 and ldap operation timeout are not needed to be parte of the unique
    id used by     LDAPConnection manager to correctly identify the binding
    handle - Eliminated duplicate code, factored into HandleWait4ResultError
    method - Introduced fUniqueId variable

    "Persistent" LdapConnections These are the design rationales: - LDAP
    accesses happen within a thread. A thread usually cannot continue as long
    it has not read all or at least   part of the data returned form the LDAP
    server.     -> There is no benefit in adding an LDAP-Connection pool, but
    it will add complexity - The different LDAP "contextes" are highly dynamic
    and cannot be determined at bootstrap. An application e.g. will   decide at
    runtime what DN and BindPassword it will use to connect to the LDAP server.
        -> Decide at the latest possible point (where the bind will take place)
    whether we have a LDAP connection ready which        will fit our needs. -
    Implement a lazy algorithm. If a worker thread wants to access the LDAP
    server, store the parameters needed to uniquely distinguish   the
    connections (Server,Port, DN, ConnectTimeout, RebindTimeout, UTF8Encoding,
    ThreadId) and allow the same thread to reuse   this connection. Only the
    connections *needed* are created and stored. - Allow transparent switching
    between pooled and not pooled accesses. TODO: - Find a mechanism to detect
    invalidated LDAP connections, e.g. when a LDAP server is restarted an we
    still hold a bind   handle. The current workaround of doing a rebind every
    n seconds may not be enough. - Use a MD5 hash to hash the uniquely
    distinguishable identifier - Added lots of TestCases

    extracted Method RenderFilterVal even if no cookies where present, fill in
    the /NrOfCookies structure (and set the counts to 0)   for the cookies
    we're interested in. switched returncode back to old semantics:
    true=cookies where sent, 0 no cookies where sent



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    Handle multiple cookies with same name correct Method HandleCookies has
    same behaviour like before. Especially, HandleCookie does not stop if it  
    encounters an error, it works upon all defined cookie names and returns an
    over all returncode (true or false)   at the end of the method. This way,
    the good cookies are still available.     - If there ise more then one
    cookie having the same name, instead of storing  AnyArrayImpl a ""  value  
        is stored     - For every cookie specified, a structure as follows is
    stored in env: 	/NrOfCookies 	{ 	    "IamOk"		1 
        "MoreThenOne" 	4 	    "IDoNotExist"	0 	}       This
    structure may be used to deliver concise error messages to the user: 
    - browser did not send cookie 	- browser sent more then one cookie
    with the same name, please delete your xy cookies Added test cases.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    this code contained three memory leaks, furthermore Strings where passed to
    ldap methods    deallocating memory, which could lead to core dumps. Fixed
    leak in: - retrieving the distinguished name 		  - releasing
    the attr structure 		  - releasing the retrieved values (this was
    done, but with the wrong call) changed String usage to plain char * usage
    where the char * must bee freed later on. These fixes  leads to reduced
    memory consumption in a login test doing 10'000 logins  of 200 MB(!)

    Fixing framework bugs: If webdisplay server establishes connections to peer
    and peer becomes unreachable   (due to crash, network interface down,
    routing problems) the worker threads having   established SSL connections
    (netstat ESTABLISHED) will wait for the default timeout   (5 minutes). Any
    timeout given / set will be ignored. This is a bug. Fix: a) Set timeout
    earlier in ProcessRequest, because GetStream() upon a SSL socket already
    does    i/o on the stream to do the SSL-handshake b) In
    SSLSocket::DoMakeStream pass the timeout to the SSLSocketStream. The
    current implementaion    does not pass a timeout and the default argument
    of 5 minutes is used.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    added (commented out) code which sets socket   to non blocking.



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    changed default message to "Page not found."



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    in the case a ldap connection was bad the WaitForResult method started
    spinning.   Fixed this behaviour for cases where timeout is not null, and a
    non blocking behaviour   with immediate return if stream is not good is
    expected

    note that HTTPProcessor and this class need some refactoring to factor the
    instance variables out   from these classes. I thing a
    HTTPProcessorInterface which gives access to the instance variables   might
    do the job, let's sse Monday. RequestReader logs now all events to
    SecurityLog, no more flags are passed to the application because   the
    logging is done entirely by RequestReader. Generate "bad request" pages
    without giving the cause why this happened Give fine tuned control over the
    request verification process Provide meaningful default (none of belwo
    settings must be given, defaults are applied) Added many testcases Added
    methods to query error state in HTTPPRocessor   The process is as follows: 
     - check URL for not encoded chars 		#! Specifies chars in a URL
    which are "safe" and must not be URL-encoded. 		#! A-Z, a-z,
    0-9, are always good plus default save chars $-_.+/?% 		#! With
    this setting you override the deafault save chars! 
    /CheckUrlEncodingOverride		""   - One-time or exhaustively decode
    the URL 	/UrlExhaustiveDecode	0 		#! Instead of rejecting
    the request,normalise the path (and re-encode the URL)   - Check the Url
    for RFC1738 unsafe chars 		#! Specifes what chars in a URL are
    considered unsafe. The default used is 		#! <>\"#%{}|\\^~[]`,
    you may override this with this setting. 
    /CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeCharsOverride "" 		#! chars > 127
    in a URL are considered unsafe (Ascii extended). Chars given 	
    #! with this setting are considered good, even when above 127. 
    /CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeCharsAsciiOverride "" 		#! Decode a
    encdoed URL until no more escape sequences are present. 		#! If
    this setting is 0, there is only a one-time decoding step.   - Check for
    directory traversial attack 	/FixDirectoryTraversial 0 	
    #! If FixDirectoryTraversial is set, specify which chars are not
    url-encoded 		#! This is needed for old webdisplay backends 
    /URLEncodeExclude		"/?" 		#! If URLEncodeExclude is set,
    you may specify which chars you don't want to 		   re-urlencode
    in a fixed url (because a directory traversial attach has been 	
       detected).

    CheckUrlEncoding takes an override set of chars to check for. If nothing is
    given,   the default applies CheckUrlPathContainsUnsafeChars:   - takes an
    override set of chars to check for   - takes a parameter triggering ascii
    extended char set check   - takes an override set of chars for the ascii
    extended check Added test cases



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    ContainsOneAbove takes now   -the waterMark to check   -A string containing
    chars which are > the waterMark (e.g. > 127) but are excluded from
    checking.    E.g. invoking    ContainsOneAbove() reports position of first
    extended ascii char    ContainsOneAbove(127,"Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼") does the same, but
    ignores "Ã¤Ã¶u" contained the string    to check Added testcases

    fixed major wd2 SSL implementation memory leak   Pointer to X509
    certificate was aquired twice.Getting the X509 cert increases a openssll
    internal   refcount, which is decremented on the X509_free call. Thus the
    refcount of the cert remained 1,   leaving the memory hole.

    fixed trace

    removed unused variable



-   2010-09-08 Marcel Huber

    When Context is used with "copy session store" semantics, a copy of the
    session store is made and used   instead of the real session store by the
    context object.   This allows concurrent threads using their contextes
    without bothering about session locking, because lookups   aiming at the
    session store end up at the (read only) copy of the session store.   The
    problem with the old implementation was a DeepClone from global storage to
    global storage, instead of   doing a deep clone from global storage to
    thread local storage.   This has been fixed.

    SSLConnector and Connector may now be configured with an allocator. Most
    uses for the Connector object   take place entirely within a thread. Thus
    there is no ovious need to allocate global memory. This improves the  
    overall performance and reduces the memory footprint.   Especially we get
    rid of the expensive copies Storage::Global <-> Storage::Current.   For
    compatibility  reasons, the default is still Storage::Global(), but you can
    easily overwrite this default. Added testcases verifying that correct
    PoolAllocator is used Changed/adapted existing testcases did some minor
    fixing of testcases
